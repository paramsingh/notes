Here's what I did this year and what I want to do in 2022.\n\n# Engineering and Career\n\nI've worked in Security for two years now. I started off with no clue about security engineering, but I've been slowly learning as I go.\nI'm still very much a Software Engineer with experience in security engineering vs a \"real\" security engineer, but I've picked up\nsome knowledge. I've gained a lot of concrete knowledge about web security and cryptography this year. However, the thing that I've\nfound really valuable to learn is the thought process and engineering practices that get used to protect large codebases being worked on by\nthousands of engineers. I'll write about things I've learned in future posts in this newsletter, but for now, I'll recommend a few good things that\nI read this year:\n\n* OWASP has been the resource for me to learn about common security things. The [top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) is a great place to start if you want to evaluate the security of your codebase.\n* I read parts of Ross Anderson's [Security Engineering](https://www.amazon.in/Security-Engineering-Building-Dependable-Distributed/dp/1119642787/) book as part of a book club, and found it both interesting and illuminating.\n\nOutside of work, I did not really build too many things this year. In the beginning of the year, I helped build [music discovery features for ListenBrainz](https://twitter.com/ListenBrainz/status/1370075981969555456), but sadly, I wasn't able to keep the momentum for the remainder of the year. After that, I have basically zero open-source contributions.\n\nI spent a lot of time helping a friend prepare for interviews as she changed jobs.\nThis involved us solving LeetCode problems together over weekends. We went over many topics,\nfrom simple ones like linked lists to more complicated ones like dynamic programming and trees.\nIn total, we must have solved at least a hundred problems. The work was worth it in the end, as my\nfriend got a few pretty cushy offers. I've always found teaching to be fun when I know the things at hand,\nand it was a nice experience overall, with the added benefit of keeping me in touch with the basics.\n\nAnother very interesting thing that I did this year related to careers was help a number of my friends\nnegotiate job offers. I had read [patio11's](https://twitter.com/patio11) [salary negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) essay\nsome time last year, and it was quite illuminating to apply the advice in the real world.\nIt made me realize how much of a jobseeker's market it is, and how much value just a single well-written email can generate.\nIf you're an engineer switching jobs, I cannot recommend the essay strongly enough.\n\nMy practice of writing notes has also continued to go well. I have a total of 170 notes on [my notes site](https://notes.param.codes) now.\nIt is a bit embarrassing, but the most useful notes on that site for me personally have been\nthe [kindle highlights of books I've read](https://notes.param.codes/notes/fa0ae1f5-c7cd-4b13-9a03-efda3ad263bf.html), things that I haven't written.\nI've found going back to just the highlights of books really helpful to remind myself the core things in a book.\n\n# Music and Books\n\nI read [15 books in 2021](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021/21281870), of which 8(!) were non-fiction.\nMy favorites were:\n\n* [Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty - Daron Acemoğlu, James A. Robinson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17434641-why-nations-fail)\n* [The Dark Forest - Liu Cixin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25680785-the-dark-forest)\n\nI also listened to a lot of music [this year](https://listenbrainz.org/user/iliekcomputers/year-in-music/). Spotify says I listened to 60,532 minutes of music this year, more than 99.5% of listeners in India. It is a little sad however that most of this is old music that I knew already, not new music. I spent only some time trying to find new music this year, however, I do have two albums from 2021 that I really like and can recommend:\n\n* [LP! - JPEGMAFIA](https://open.spotify.com/album/4inXqcdjG79gV4m2mU8dQh)\n* [Sometimes I Might Be Introvert - Little Simz](https://open.spotify.com/album/0DBoWQ52XUHtrZQdfAqOVj)\n\n# Health\n\nI gained a lot of weight in 2020, and realized I needed to do something about it this year.\nI picked up running in the beginning of the year when lockdowns were strict and gyms were closed. I've made a lot of progress through the year.\n\nOver the year, I've run 442.4 km outside, not counting workouts on the treadmill or in the gym. I ran a [half-marathon (21.1 km)](https://www.strava.com/activities/5417172455/overview) in 2hr40min in June. The time isn't very impressive, but just being able to run the distance was huge for me. After that, I focussed\non strength training and did [Stronglifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) for 2 months, before doing squats every workout became too much for me.\n\nI started focussing back on running in November, with the goal of a 25 min 5k, my current best is 29:30.\nI find running more fun that strength training, so I'm planning on focussing more on running while doing some strength training in the future.\n\n\nThe number of workouts (runs/strength training/other cardio all included) per month is as follows:\n\nDecember - 14\nNovember - 10\nOctober - 12\nSeptember - 5\nAugust - 5\nJuly - 8\nJune - 17\nMay - 19\nApril - 15\nMarch - 18\nFebruary (start) - 8\n\nAugust and September were not good months, I lost a bit of motivation and I think I didn't track a few workouts too.\nMy goal going forward is 4 runs a week, which should mean at least 16 workouts a month for 2021.\n\nIn terms of weight, I went from 77 kg (nearing obesity) in the beginning of the year to 65 kg in May. After that, I\ngot back to 69 kg as I wanted to gain some muscle with strength training. Since September, I've been stable at 69kg, which\nseems a nice number to me.\n\n# Chess\n\nI spent a lot of time playing chess on [Lichess](https://lichess.org) this year. I played a total of 2,856 games which is a bit crazy, even if 1,866 of them were 1 minute bullet games. I don't have much to show for the thousands of bullet games, but I have slowly improved in longer time controls. My rapid (games with ~10-15 minutes per side) rating peaked at 1803 in November, before settling down to 1760 for the end of the year. My blitz (games with ~3-5 minutes per side) rating showed the most improvement, I've gone from 1462 at the beginning of the year to 1682 right now, peaking at 1694 (painfully close to 1700).\n\nMost of this improvement is from passively watching chess content on youtube. Channels I can recommend are [Eric Rosen](https://www.youtube.com/user/RosenChess) and [GothamChess](https://www.youtube.com/c/GothamChess). I also did a lot of puzzles on lichess in free time, my puzzle rating right now is 2309, I started the year at 1797. I also have been reading Jeremy Silman's [How To Reassess Your Chess](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Reassess-Your-Chess-Imbalances/dp/1890085138) on and off over the past 3-4 months.\n\n# Goals\n\nI have the following goals for 2022.\n\n* 50 min 10k\n* 1900 lichess blitz, 2000 rapid\n* Keep writing this newsletter\n* Read 15 books (at least 5 non-fiction)\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/vMSK4K8Bl1JnReDs7ZViM.html","relUrl":"notes/vMSK4K8Bl1JnReDs7ZViM.html"},{"doc":"Week of December 24, 2021","title":"Week of December 24, 2021","hpath":"weekly.2021.12.24","content":"","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/mOerh05CGlzjLX7RQq15J.html","relUrl":"notes/mOerh05CGlzjLX7RQq15J.html"},{"doc":"Spider-Man: No Way Home","title":"Spider-Man: No Way Home","hpath":"weekly.2021.12.24.no_way_home","content":"\n(SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU CARE EVEN REMOTELY ABOUT MARVEL MOVIES AND HAVE NOT SEEN THE NEW SPIDER-MAN MOVIE.)\n\n\nThe [new Spider-Man movie](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spider_man_no_way_home) was released this week.\nIt's an ambitious project. It combines 20 years of Spider-Man films, uniting the three film iterations of the character via multiversal shenanigans.\nIt was a good movie, massive in scope and that scope still felt deserved.\n\nWhen I watch these amazing Marvel movies (The last two Avengers were more ambitious.), I rue the wasted potential of Marvel's counterparts at DC. DC had Superman and Batman. They also had [amazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Returns) [stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Come_(comics)) which are undisputed classics. I hate that DC wasn't able to adapt these stories on film. Two decades ago, Marvel was _bankrupt_. The comics weren't doing well, no-one cared about characters other than the X-Men and Spider-Man. Why has Marvel done so much better than DC?\n\nMarvel had vision, while DC didn't (and still does not). DC didn't know what to do with their characters, except for Batman. After Marvel released the first Avengers, DC were relegated to playing catch-up. They wanted to do a team up movie to rival the scale of Avengers, but none of it felt deserved. Marvel started small, built up momentum, waited things out before making their biggest plays. Thanos was built up for half a decade before they made him the main antagonist of a movie. Contrast that with DC, where there was no build-up. No patience! They adapted one of Superman's classic stories, [The Death of Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Superman), before he even had a second solo movie.\n\nMarvel trusts their source material and audience. When the first Avengers was released, even the craziest fans did not dream of a multiverse-spanning Spider-Man crossover with three different Spider-Men and villains from decades ago. You only found these kind of stories in comicbooks, they weren't meant for the less geeky audience of film. However, Marvel hasn't been afraid of leaning into this kind of stuff for years now. They're growing more confident with each success. Each success makes their ambition more deserved. I am very excited to see what they come up with in the future, it still feels like the beginning.\n\nI should still note though, you can't just throw normal audiences into too much craziness in your first movie, you have to be patient and do the simpler things correctly first. The [first Spider-Man movie](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spider_man_homecoming) was a simple Spider-Man tale fighting the Vulture. It hit the right beats for a new Spider-Man movie and made you care about the new Spider-Man.\n\nDC started reasonably with [Man of Steel](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_man_of_steel), which was an okay movie, it had hints of not understanding the Superman character (Superman killing Zod is wildly out of character), but still left you hoping that maybe there were better things to come. The follow-up tried to do too many things too quickly. It introduced Batman, Lex Luthor, Doomsday and Wonder Woman. Each of these characters could stand on their own in individual films. It also adapted Death of Superman, which meant killing Superman in his second movie before he's had any real character development, and going into Justice League with a dead Superman that will need to be revived somehow.\n\nThis was all so rushed. I cared a lot about these characters, Superman is my favourite character in all fiction, but I still did not feel invested in these movies. If core fans don't care about your stuff, you can't even remotely expect normal people to. DC is still making the same mistakes. The upcoming Flash movie is overly complicated already, it has two Batmen, introduces Supergirl and wants to adapt Flashpoint but there is zero buildup to any of this.\n\nI've always considered myself more of a DC fan than Marvel, the DC characters just resonate more with me. It's been disappointing to see these characters being at less than their best for years. However, I find a lot of comfort in the fact that Marvel has been elevating their characters in live-action for decades now. There is no Iron Man comic story better than the storyline for MCU Iron Man. I'm really looking forward to Marvel's future movies, and I hope they continue their brave venture into crazy comicbook territory. I also hope that DC finds their way somehow, but that looks very very improbable right now.\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/avsCQQZuo7gjntKQ3gXpC.html","relUrl":"notes/avsCQQZuo7gjntKQ3gXpC.html"},{"doc":"Week of December 17, 2021","title":"Week of December 17, 2021","hpath":"weekly.2021.12.17","content":"\n# log4j\n\n[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/blog/digging-deeper-into-log4shell-0day-rce-exploit-found-in-log4j) has a good explanation of the log4j vulnerability that allowed easy remote code execution by attackers. Lots of hugs to all the engineers who were on-call this week.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you somehow log a specific type of URL, the library was looking up the URL and dynamically loading code that the URL might be sending back. It's a pretty crazy exploit, it's very weird to me that a logging library is ever looking up URLs. That just seems like the *last* thing you'd expect a logging library to do.\n\nThe [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608) fixing it was really interesting. There was a [comment](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990065982) that stood out to me.\n\n>It is very surprising that this critical security issue does not seem to have received due attention. It was reported to Apache half a month ago, but it was not fixed until five days ago. Even today, it has not released a new stable version to solve it.\n\nI don't think it's surprising. It's definitely not ideal, but it's not surprising. The fact that open source is massively underfunded is basically a meme at this point. I always like linking this [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/2347/) because it's just so true.\n\nI worked on open-source software for years with MetaBrainz, which is probably much better funded than most other open-source projects, but even still, going from MetaBrainz to Stripe was such culture shock to me, because the engineering resources that were available was just on another level. Things can get prioritized, it's not just one developer wearing ten hats, doing development, code review, releases, support. It's very easy to miss things even if you're working full time, and most of open-source is developed by people in their free time, outside of their regular job.\n\nLuckily, the main developer of log4j now has [hundreds of supporters](https://github.com/sponsors/rgoers), but that's just log4j, there are probably so many core infrastructural open source projects that have near zero engineering resources behind them. If you use and like something open-source, you should try to support the creators and donate.\n\n\n# Things of interest\n\nI read this great blog post this week: https://lyncredible.com/2020/04/06/reflecting-on-my-ic-path-part-i/\n\n>I finally realized that careers are not like schools. In schools, grades are leading indicators. At the start of every school year, you level up, learn some new lessons and work on some new projects. In careers however, getting a good grade and finishing a year does not guarantee a level up into the next grade. Instead, I should treat leveling as a lagging indicator. The change has to start with my mindset and my behavior. After all, most every tech company requires you to already perform at the next level before leveling you up.\n\n-------------------\n\nListenBrainz released an [Year in Music](https://listenbrainz.org/user/iliekcomputers/year-in-music/) report for 2021. This is one project that I always wanted to build in my years of working on ListenBrainz. Sadly, I wasn't involved because it's hard for me to manage time, but I'm still really happy to see it built. Also, no real surprise that no meeting wednesday is the day I listened to the most music on average.\n\n----------------------\n\nI'm reading [a book by Stephen Webb](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00XVTG1NC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on the Fermi Paradox and was introduced to the absolutely mind-boggling idea of a [Dyson Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere).

I'm learning how Go web applications work. It's a bit overwhelming that there are so many things that you can use to build Go web applications. So far, I've seen the following libraries in use in real services:\n\n* [Gorilla](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/)\n* [Goji](https://goji.io/)\n* [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)\n\nThe good thing is that they are all kinda similar at the core, so you're not really drowning in the multitude of ways to do the same thing.\n\nI'm not a Go expert by any means, and I did hit an issue that I did not like. There's no good way to mock internal dependencies in tests in Go.\n\nFor example, let's take this Python test\n\n```python\n# code\ndef my_method():\n    internal_method()\n\n# tests\n@patch('internal_method')\ndef test_my_method(mock_internal_method):\n    my_method()\n    mock_internal_method.assert_called_once()\n```\n\nThere is no real Go equivalent to the `mock_internal_method.assert_called_once()`.\nAs I understand, you either need to make the `internal_method` something\nthat `my_method` takes as an input, so that your test can pass in a mock method.\nThere's a good [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52381358/test-that-method-is-called-in-handler-in-golang)\non stack overflow about this. This does make things a bit more complicated than needed, but I gueuss Go is\nopinionated and this is just one of those opinions.\n\nThe Go equivalent to the same test would be something like this.\n\n```go\n// code\n\n// need to create this struct to wrap the real internalMethod\n// so that we can inject a mock value for internalMethod in our tests\ntype internalMethodStruct struct {}\n\nfunc (im *internalMethodStruct) InternalMethod() {\n    internalMethod()\n}\n\nfunc MyMethod(im internalMethodStruct) {\n    im.InternalMethod()\n}\n\n// tests\ntype spy struct {\n    called boolean\n}\n\nfunc (s *spy) InternalMethod() {\n    s.called = true\n}\n\nfunc TestMyMethod(t *testing.T) {\n    spyObj := &spy{called: false}\n    MyMethod(spyObj)\n    assert.equal(true, spyObj.called)\n}\n```\n\nSee how much work that is! The fact that you have to create an interface,\nmake your method take the interface as input and then\ncreate a spy in the test seems a bit too much to me.\n\n\n# Write good documentation.\n\nMy team owns some docs that have been read by basically every team in the engineering org at this point. I spent last week identifying issues in those docs and then improving them by fixing those issues. There are a couple of interesting things I noticed that I've internalized as good things to keep in mind when writing documentation.\n\n* If you're asking someone to do some work like migrating to a secure library you built instead of rolling their own code, you really really need to be very clear on why that work is important. If you don't get it across that the work is important, the person doing it will think \"Why am I even doing this?!\" the instant they find something confusing. You're basically setting your docs up for failure if the motivation of the work is not clear.\n\n* You need to make things as obvious as possible. As much as possible, give the reader a clear default wherever they have to make a choice, with a link to other choices possible. Putting a list of choices in front of the reader is just asking for confusion.\n\n  * **Good**: You need to do X. There are multiple ways to do it but we strongly recommend the way A. There are other ways to do it, see this linked supporting doc.\n\n  * **Bad**: You need to do X. Based on your usecase, you can either do it in the A way or the B way or the C way.\n\n  This example is overly simple, but the point still stands.\n\n* The structure of your document is really important. You do not want to put things that the reader doesn't care about at the top and the meat of the content near the bottom. Doing this is basically an invitation asking people to not read your document carefully and just skim it.\n\n# Things of interest\n\n## India's population\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/asia/2021/12/02/indias-population-will-start-to-shrink-sooner-than-expected\n\nIndia's fertility rate has fallen below replacement level.\n\n>This is big news not just for India but, seeing that its 1.4bn people are nearly a fifth of humanity, for the planet. The number of Indians will still grow, because many young women have yet to reach child-bearing age. But lower fertility means the population will peak sooner and at a lower figure: not in 40 years at more than 1.7bn, as was widely predicted, but probably a decade earlier, at perhaps 1.6bn.\n\n## World Chess Championship\n\nMagnus Carlsen defended his championship today, destroying Ian Nepomniachtchi 7.5 - 3.5, winning 4 games, drawing 7 and losing none. The first 5 games of the match were draws, but in game 6, Magnus won after playing a 136 move game that went on for ~8 hours. In the end, the game was a theoretical draw, but Magnus kept pushing until Nepomniachtchi made a losing mistake.\n\nThe psychological impact of this long game was really interesting to me, because after this, Nepomniachtchi crumbled, playing \"below grandmaster level\" (in his own words), and losing 3 games out of the 5 that were played after game 6. Computers don't have such psychological issues.\n\nThe 136 move game is one of the best chess games I've seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmQs1KhB948\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/9U3oJC3nKIHy1QdivJAHy.html","relUrl":"notes/9U3oJC3nKIHy1QdivJAHy.html"},{"doc":"Security","title":"Security","hpath":"security","content":"\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/736e882a-5670-469f-aee2-1f1209c69cf4.html","relUrl":"notes/736e882a-5670-469f-aee2-1f1209c69cf4.html"},{"doc":"Threat Modeling","title":"Threat Modeling","hpath":"security.threat_modeling","content":"\nA threat model is a living artifact that helps us reason about the security of a system.\n\nThreat modeling helps define system appropriate security requirements and helps\nfind security issues that might not be found otherwise.

The losers have been the Egyptian people, as they only too well understand.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Spaniards, while trying to survive, started sending out expeditions to find a new place that would offer greater riches and populations easier to coerce. In 1537 one of these expeditions, under the leadership of Juan de Ayolas, penetrated up the Paraná River, searching for a route to the Incas. On its way, it made contact with the Guaraní, a sedentary people with an agricultural economy based on maize and cassava. De Ayolas immediately realized that the Guaraní were a completely different proposition from the Charrúas and the Querandí. After a brief conflict, the Spanish overcame Guaraní resistance and founded a town, Nuestra Señora de Santa María de la Asunción, which remains the capital of Paraguay today.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"within four years Buenos Aires was abandoned as all the Spaniards who’d settled there moved to the new town.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Early Spanish and, as we will see, English colonists were not interested in tilling the soil themselves; they wanted others to do it for them, and they wanted riches, gold and silver, to plunder.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Spanish expansion and colonization of the Americas began in earnest with the invasion of Mexico by Hernán Cortés in 1519, the expedition of Francisco Pizarro to Peru a decade and a half later, and the expedition of Pedro de Mendoza to the Río de la Plata just two years after that. Over the next century, Spain conquered and colonized most of central, western, and southern South America, while Portugal claimed Brazil to the east.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When Cortés and his men arrived at the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519, they were welcomed by Moctezuma, the Aztec emperor, who had decided, in the face of much advice from his counselors, to welcome the Spaniards peacefully.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The strategy and institutions of conquest perfected in Mexico were eagerly adopted elsewhere in the Spanish Empire. Nowhere was this done more effectively than in Pizarro’s conquest of Peru.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Spanish laid a trap and sprang it. They killed Atahualpa’s guards and retainers, possibly as many as two thousand people, and captured the king. To gain his freedom, Atahualpa had to promise to fill one room with gold and two more of the same size with silver. He did this, but the Spanish, reneging on their promises, strangled him in July 1533. That November, the Spanish captured the Inca capital of Cusco, where the Incan aristocracy received the same treatment as Atahualpa, being imprisoned until they produced gold and silver.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Then he revived and adapted an Inca labor institution known as the mita, which, in the Incas’ language, Quechua, means “a turn.” Under their mita system, the Incas had used forced labor to run plantations designed to provide food for temples, the aristocracy, and the army. In return, the Inca elite provided famine relief and security. In de Toledo’s hands the mita, especially the Potosí mita, was to become the largest and most onerous scheme of labor exploitation in the Spanish colonial period. De Toledo defined a huge catchment area, running from the middle of modern-day Peru and encompassing most of modern Bolivia. It covered about two hundred thousand square miles. In this area, one-seventh of the male inhabitants, newly arrived in their reducciones, were required to work in the mines at Potosí. The Potosí mita endured throughout the entire colonial period and was abolished only in 1825.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"They chose North America not because it was attractive, but because it was all that was available. The “desirable” parts of the Americas, where the indigenous population to exploit was plentiful and where the gold and silver mines were located, had already been occupied. The English got the leftovers.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On May 14, 1607, they founded the settlement of Jamestown. Though the settlers on board the ships owned by the Virginia Company were English, they had a model of colonization heavily influenced by the template set up by Cortés, Pizarro, and de Toledo. Their first plan was to capture the local chief and use him as a way to get provisions and to coerce the population into producing food and wealth for them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The situation was rescued by Captain John Smith. Smith, whose writings provide one of our main sources of information about the early development of the colony, was a larger-than-life character. Born in England, in rural Lincolnshire, he disregarded his father’s desires for him to go into business and instead became a soldier of fortune.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"With Newport sailing back to England for supplies and more colonists, and Wingfield uncertain about what to do, it was Smith who saved the colony. He initiated a series of trading missions that secured vital food supplies. On one of these he was captured by Opechancanough, one of Wahunsunacock’s younger brothers, and was brought before the king at Werowocomoco. He was the first Englishman to meet Wahunsunacock, and it was at this initial meeting that according to some accounts Smith’s life was saved only at the intervention of Wahunsunacock’s young daughter Pocahontas.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Back in the settlement, Smith was completely in charge and imposed the rule that “he that will not worke shall not eat.” Jamestown survived a second winter.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The new mode of governance left no room for Smith, who, disgruntled, returned to England in the autumn of 1609. Without his resourcefulness, and with Wahunsunacock throttling the food supply, the colonists in Jamestown perished. Of the five hundred who entered the winter, only sixty were alive by March. The situation was so desperate that they resorted to cannibalism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since it was possible to coerce neither the locals nor the settlers, the only alternative was to give the settlers incentives. In 1618 the company began the “headright system,” which gave each male settler fifty acres of land and fifty more acres for each member of his family and for all servants that a family could bring to Virginia.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the only option for an economically viable colony was to create institutions that gave the colonists incentives to invest and to work hard.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In all cases it proved to be impossible to force settlers into a rigid hierarchical society, because there were simply too many options open to them in the New World. Instead, they had to be provided with incentives for them to want to work. And soon they were demanding more economic freedom and further political rights.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It was more like class or even ethnic warfare than an independence movement, and it united all the elites in opposition. If independence allowed popular participation in politics, the local elites, not just Spaniards, were against it. Consequentially, Mexican elites viewed the Cádiz Constitution, which opened the way to popular participation, with extreme skepticism; they would never recognize its legitimacy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States did not create a democracy by modern standards. Who could vote in elections was left up to the individual states to determine. While northern states quickly conceded the vote to all white men irrespective of how much income they earned or property they owned, southern states did so only gradually. No state enfranchised women or slaves, and as property and wealth restrictions were lifted on white men, racial franchises explicitly disenfranchising black men were introduced.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Civil War was bloody and destructive. But both before and after it there were ample economic opportunities for a large fraction of the population, especially in the northern and western United States. The situation in Mexico was very different.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The striking thing about the evidence on patenting in the United States is that people who were granted patents came from all sorts of backgrounds and all walks of life, not just the rich and the elite. Many made fortunes based on their patents.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Just as the United States in the nineteenth century was more democratic politically than almost any other nation in the world at the time, it was also more democratic than others when it came to innovation. This was critical to its path to becoming the most economically innovative nation in the world.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In fact, in 1910, the year in which the Mexican Revolution started, there were only forty-two banks in Mexico, and two of these controlled 60 percent of total banking assets.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Like Iturbide and Santa Ana before him, Díaz started life as a military commander. Such a career path into politics was certainly known in the United States. The first president of the United States, George Washington, was also a successful general in the War of Independence. Ulysses S. Grant, one of the victorious Union generals of the Civil War, became president in 1869, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during the Second World War, was president of the United States between 1953 and 1961. Unlike Iturbide, Santa Ana, and Díaz, however, none of these military men used force to get into power.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Díaz violated people’s property rights, facilitating the expropriation of vast amounts of land, and he granted monopolies and favors to his supporters in all lines of business, including banking.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the profit motive, which underpinned the monopolistic nature of the banking industry in Mexico, was present in the United States, too. But this profit motive was channeled differently because of the radically different U.S. institutions. The bankers faced different economic institutions, institutions that subjected them to much greater competition. And this was largely because the politicians who wrote the rules for the bankers faced very different incentives themselves, forged by different political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the United States a long series of legislative acts, ranging from the Land Ordinance of 1785 to the Homestead Act of 1862, gave broad access to frontier lands. Though indigenous peoples had been sidelined, this created an egalitarian and economically dynamic frontier. In most Latin American countries, however, the political institutions there created a very different outcome. Frontier lands were allocated to the politically powerful and those with wealth and contacts, making such people even more powerful.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The economic institutions that made Carlos Slim who he is are very different from those in the United States. If you’re a Mexican entrepreneur, entry barriers will play a crucial role at every stage of your career. These barriers include expensive licenses you have to obtain, red tape you have to cut through, politicians and incumbents who will stand in your way, and the difficulty of getting funding from a financial sector often in cahoots with the incumbents you’re trying to compete against. These barriers can be either insurmountable, keeping you out of lucrative areas, or your greatest friend, keeping your competitors at bay.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Slim has made his money in the Mexican economy in large part thanks to his political connections. When he has ventured into the United States, he has not been successful. In 1999 his Grupo Curso bought the computer retailer CompUSA. At the time, CompUSA had given a franchise to a firm called COC Services to sell its merchandise in Mexico. Slim immediately violated this contract with the intention of setting up his own chain of stores, without any competition from COC. But COC sued CompUSA in a Dallas court. There are no amparos in Dallas, so Slim lost, and was fined $454 million.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In rich countries, individuals are healthier, live longer, and are much better educated. They also have access to a range of amenities and options in life, from vacations to career paths, that people in poor countries can only dream of. People in rich countries also drive on roads without potholes, and enjoy toilets, electricity, and running water in their houses. They also typically have governments that do not arbitrarily arrest or harass them; on the contrary, the governments provide services, including education, health care, roads, and law and order. Notable, too, is the fact that the citizens vote in elections and have some voice in the political direction their countries take.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The average citizen of the United States is seven times as prosperous as the average Mexican and more than ten times as the resident of Peru or Central America. She is about twenty times as prosperous as the average inhabitant of sub-Saharan Africa, and almost forty times as those living in the poorest African countries such as Mali, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The reason that Nogales, Arizona, is much richer than Nogales, Sonora, is simple; it is because of the very different institutions on the two sides of the border, which create very different incentives for the inhabitants of Nogales, Arizona, versus Nogales, Sonora.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As institutions influence behavior and incentives in real life, they forge the success or failure of nations.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"These entrepreneurs were confident from the beginning that their dream projects could be implemented: they trusted the institutions and the rule of law that these generated and they did not worry about the security of their property rights.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"while economic institutions are critical for determining whether a country is poor or prosperous, it is politics and political institutions that determine what economic institutions a country has.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is no necessity for a society to develop or adopt the institutions that are best for economic growth or the welfare of its citizens, because other institutions may be even better for those who control politics and political institutions. The powerful and the rest of society will often disagree about which set of institutions should remain in place and which ones should be changed. Carlos Slim would not have been happy to see his political connections disappear and the entry barriers protecting his businesses fizzle—no matter that the entry of new businesses would enrich millions of Mexicans.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The great inequality of the modern world that emerged in the nineteenth century was caused by the uneven dissemination of industrial technologies and manufacturing production. It was not caused by divergence in agricultural performance.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China, despite many imperfections in its economic and political system, has been the most rapidly growing nation of the past three decades. Chinese poverty until Mao Zedong’s death had nothing to do with Chinese culture; it was due to the disastrous way Mao organized the economy and conducted politics. In the 1950s, he promoted the Great Leap Forward, a drastic industrialization policy that led to mass starvation and famine. In the 1960s, he propagated the Cultural Revolution, which led to the mass persecution of intellectuals and educated people—anyone whose party loyalty might be doubted. This again led to terror and a huge waste of the society’s talent and resources. In the same way, current Chinese growth has nothing to do with Chinese values or changes in Chinese culture; it results from a process of economic transformation unleashed by the reforms implemented by Deng Xiaoping and his allies, who, after Mao Zedong’s death, gradually abandoned socialist economic policies and institutions, first in agriculture and then in industry.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The ignorance hypothesis maintains that poor countries are poor because they have a lot of market failures and because economists and policymakers do not know how to get rid of them and have heeded the wrong advice in the past. Rich countries are rich because they have figured out better policies and have successfully eliminated these failures.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On the face of it, the sustained economic decline that soon set in in Ghana after independence from Britain was caused by ignorance. The British economist Tony Killick, then working as an adviser for the government of Kwame Nkrumah, recorded many of the problems in great detail.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This endless stream of economically irrational developments was not caused by the fact that Nkrumah or his advisers were badly informed or ignorant of the right economic policies. They had people like Killick and had even been advised by Nobel laureate Sir Arthur Lewis, who knew the policies were not good. What drove the form the economic policies took was the fact that Nkrumah needed to use them to buy political support and sustain his undemocratic regime.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"After all, if ignorance were the problem, well-meaning leaders would quickly learn what types of policies increased their citizens’ incomes and welfare, and would gravitate toward those policies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It wasn’t differences in knowledge or intentions between John Smith and Cortés that laid the seeds of divergence during the colonial period, and it wasn’t differences in knowledge between later U.S. presidents, such as Teddy Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson, and Porfirio Díaz that made Mexico choose economic institutions that enriched elites at the expense of the rest of society at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries while Roosevelt and Wilson did the opposite. Rather, it was the differences in the institutional constraints the countries’ presidents and elites were facing.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The experience of Ghana’s prime minister in 1971, Kofi Busia, illustrates how misleading the ignorance hypothesis can be. Busia faced a dangerous economic crisis. After coming to power in 1969, he, like Nkrumah before him, pursued unsustainable expansionary economic policies and maintained various price controls through marketing boards and an overvalued exchange rate. Though Busia had been an opponent of Nkrumah, and led a democratic government, he faced many of the same political constraints.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The policies were chosen because they were good politics, enabling Busia to transfer resources to politically powerful groups, for example in urban areas, who needed to be kept contented.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"on December 27, 1971, Busia signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund that included a massive devaluation of the currency. The IMF, the World Bank, and the entire international community put pressure on Busia to implement the reforms contained in the agreement.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The immediate consequence of the currency’s devaluation was rioting and discontent in Accra, Ghana’s capital, that mounted uncontrollably until Busia was overthrown by the military, led by Lieutenant Colonel Acheampong, who immediately reversed the devaluation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the main obstacle to the adoption of policies that would reduce market failures and encourage economic growth is not the ignorance of politicians but the incentives and constraints they face from the political and economic institutions in their societies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China, for example, is one of the countries that made the switch from economic policies that caused poverty and the starvation of millions to those encouraging economic growth. But, as we will discuss in greater detail later, this did not happen because the Chinese Communist Party finally understood that the collective ownership of agricultural land and industry created terrible economic incentives. Instead, Deng Xiaoping and his allies, who were no less self-interested than their rivals but who had different interests and political objectives, defeated their powerful opponents in the Communist Party and masterminded a political revolution of sorts, radically changing the leadership and direction of the party. Their economic reforms, which created market incentives in agriculture and then subsequently in industry, followed from this political revolution. It was politics that determined the switch from communism and toward market incentives in China, not better advice or a better understanding of how the economy worked.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"poor countries are poor because those who have power make choices that create poverty. They get it wrong not by mistake or ignorance but on purpose.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Within a month of Japan’s August 15 unconditional surrender, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two spheres of influence. The South was administered by the United States. The North, by Russia. The uneasy peace of the cold war was shattered in June 1950 when the North Korean army invaded the South.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When the brothers met, Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn asked about how life was north of the 38th parallel. He had a car, but his brother didn’t. “Do you have a telephone?” he asked his brother. “No,” said his brother. “My daughter, who works at the Foreign Ministry, has a phone, but if you don’t know the code you can’t call.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"South Korea was led, and its early economic and political institutions were shaped, by the Harvard- and Princeton-educated, staunchly anticommunist Syngman Rhee, with significant support from the United States.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Forged in the midst of the Korean War and against the threat of communism spreading to the south of the 38th parallel, South Korea was no democracy. Both Rhee and his equally famous successor, General Park Chung-Hee, secured their places in history as authoritarian presidents. But both governed a market economy where private property was recognized, and after 1961, Park effectively threw the weight of the state behind rapid economic growth, channeling credit and subsidies to firms that were successful.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kim Il-Sung, a leader of anti-Japanese communist partisans during the Second World War, established himself as dictator by 1947 and, with the help of the Soviet Union, introduced a rigid form of centrally planned economy as part of the so-called Juche system. Private property was outlawed, and markets were banned. Freedoms were curtailed not only in the marketplace, but in every sphere of North Koreans’ lives—except for those who happened to be part of the very small ruling elite around Kim Il-Sung and, later, his son and successor Kim Jong-Il.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Il-Sung’s command economy and the Juche system soon proved to be a disaster. Detailed statistics are not available from North Korea, which is a secretive state, to say the least. Nonetheless, available evidence confirms what we know from the all-too-often recurring famines: not only did industrial production fail to take off, but North Korea in fact experienced a collapse in agricultural productivity.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By the late 1990s, in just about half a century, South Korean growth and North Korean stagnation led to a tenfold gap between the two halves of this once-united country—imagine what a difference a couple of centuries could make.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"These teenagers know that they will not be able to own property, start a business, or become more prosperous even if many people engage illegally in private economic activities to make a living. They also know that they will not have legal access to markets where they can use their skills or their earnings to purchase the goods they need and desire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Those in the South obtain a good education, and face incentives that encourage them to exert effort and excel in their chosen vocation. South Korea is a market economy, built on private property. South Korean teenagers know that, if successful as entrepreneurs or workers, they can one day enjoy the fruits of their investments and efforts; they can improve their standard of living and buy cars, houses, and health care.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inclusive economic institutions, such as those in South Korea or in the United States, are those that allow and encourage participation by the great mass of people in economic activities that make best use of their talents and skills and that enable individuals to make the choices they wish.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inclusive economic institutions foster economic activity, productivity growth, and economic prosperity. Secure private property rights are central, since only those with such rights will be willing to invest and increase productivity. A businessman who expects his output to be stolen, expropriated, or entirely taxed away will have little incentive to work, let alone any incentive to undertake investments and innovations.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But such rights must exist for the majority of people in society.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inclusive economic institutions require secure property rights and economic opportunities not just for the elite but for a broad cross-section of society.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In neither type of society was the vast mass of people able to make the economic decisions they wanted to; they were subject to mass coercion.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We call such institutions, which have opposite properties to those we call inclusive, extractive economic institutions—extractive because such institutions are designed to extract incomes and wealth from one subset of society to benefit a different subset.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inclusive economic institutions also pave the way for two other engines of prosperity: technology and education. Sustained economic growth is almost always accompanied by technological improvements that enable people (labor), land, and existing capital (buildings, existing machines, and so on) to become more productive.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It should therefore be no surprise that it was U.S. society, not Mexico or Peru, that produced Thomas Edison, and that it was South Korea, not North Korea, that today produces technologically innovative companies such as Samsung and Hyundai.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The United States could produce, or attract from foreign lands, the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Jeff Bezos, and the hundreds of scientists who made fundamental discoveries in information technology, nuclear power, biotech, and other fields upon which these entrepreneurs built their businesses. The supply of talent was there to be harnessed because most teenagers in the United States have access to as much schooling as they wish or are capable of attaining. Now imagine a different society, for example the Congo or Haiti, where a large fraction of the population has no means of attending school, or where, if they manage to go to school, the quality of teaching is lamentable, where teachers do not show up for work, and even if they do, there may not be any books.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The low education level of poor countries is caused by economic institutions that fail to create incentives for parents to educate their children and by political institutions that fail to induce the government to build, finance, and support schools and the wishes of parents and children.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Politics is the process by which a society chooses the rules that will govern it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If the distribution of power is narrow and unconstrained, then the political institutions are absolutist, as exemplified by the absolutist monarchies reigning throughout the world during much of history. Under absolutist political institutions such as those in North Korea and colonial Latin America, those who can wield this power will be able to set up economic institutions to enrich themselves and augment their power at the expense of society. In contrast, political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and subject it to constraints are pluralistic. Instead of being vested in a single individual or a narrow group, political power rests with a broad coalition or a plurality of groups.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Max Weber, who we met in the previous chapter, provided the most famous and widely accepted definition of the state, identifying it with the “monopoly of legitimate violence” in society. Without such a monopoly and the degree of centralization that it entails, the state cannot play its role as enforcer of law and order, let alone provide public services and encourage and regulate economic activity. When the state fails to achieve almost any political centralization, society sooner or later descends into chaos, as did Somalia.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We will refer to political institutions that are sufficiently centralized and pluralistic as inclusive political institutions. When either of these conditions fails, we will refer to the institutions as extractive political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When existing elites are challenged under extractive political institutions and the newcomers break through, the newcomers are likewise subject to only a few constraints. They thus have incentives to maintain these political institutions and create a similar set of economic institutions, as Porfirio Díaz and the elite surrounding him did at the end of the nineteenth century in Mexico.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Such political institutions also make it harder for others to usurp power and undermine the foundations of inclusive institutions. Those controlling political power cannot easily use it to set up extractive economic institutions for their own benefit. Inclusive economic institutions, in turn, create a more equitable distribution of resources, facilitating the persistence of inclusive political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In fact, combinations of extractive and inclusive institutions are generally unstable.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"inclusive economic institutions will neither support nor be supported by extractive political ones. Either they will be transformed into extractive economic institutions to the benefit of the narrow interests that hold power, or the economic dynamism they create will destabilize the extractive political institutions, opening the way for the emergence of inclusive political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Economic institutions that create incentives for economic progress may simultaneously redistribute income and power in such a way that a predatory dictator and others with political power may become worse off.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"New sectors attract resources away from old ones. New firms take business away from established ones. New technologies make existing skills and machines obsolete. The process of economic growth and the inclusive institutions upon which it is based create losers as well as winners in the political arena and in the economic marketplace. Fear of creative destruction is often at the root of the opposition to inclusive economic and political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"powerful groups often stand against economic progress and against the engines of prosperity. Economic growth is not just a process of more and better machines, and more and better educated people, but also a transformative and destabilizing process associated with widespread creative destruction.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When there is a conflict, the wishes of all parties cannot be simultaneously met. Some will be defeated and frustrated, while others will succeed in securing outcomes they like. Who the winners of this conflict are has fundamental implications for a nation’s economic trajectory. If the groups standing against growth are the winners, they can successfully block economic growth, and the economy will stagnate.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Reforming economic institutions to improve individual property rights would have made the Kongolese society at large more prosperous. But it is unlikely that the elite would have benefited from this wider prosperity. First, such reforms would have made the elite economic losers, by undermining the wealth that the slave trade and slave plantations brought them. Second, such reforms would have been possible only if the political power of the king and the elite were curtailed.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"First, even if economic institutions are extractive, growth is possible when elites can directly allocate resources to high-productivity activities that they themselves control.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The second type of growth under extractive political institutions arises when the institutions permit the development of somewhat, even if not completely, inclusive economic institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The rapid industrialization of South Korea under General Park is an example. Park came to power via a military coup in 1961, but he did so in a society heavily supported by the United States and with an economy where economic institutions were essentially inclusive. Though Park’s regime was authoritarian, it felt secure enough to promote economic growth, and in fact did so very actively—perhaps partly because the regime was not directly supported by extractive economic institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Differently from the Soviet Union and most other cases of growth under extractive institutions, South Korea transitioned from extractive political institutions toward inclusive political institutions in the 1980s. This successful transition was due to a confluence of factors. By the 1970s, economic institutions in South Korea had become sufficiently inclusive that they reduced one of the strong rationales for extractive political institutions—the economic elite had little to gain from their own or the military’s dominance of politics. The relative equality of income in South Korea also meant that the elite had less to fear from pluralism and democracy. The key influence of the United States, particularly given the threat from North Korea, also meant that the strong democracy movement that challenged the military dictatorship could not be repressed for long.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though General Park’s assassination in 1979 was followed by another military coup, led by Chun Doo-hwan, Chun’s chosen successor, Roh Tae-woo, initiated a process of political reforms that led to the consolidation of a pluralistic democracy after 1992.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"While the early stages of Chinese growth were spearheaded by radical market reforms in the agricultural sector, reforms in the industrial sector have been more muted. Even today, the state and the Communist Party play a central role in deciding which sectors and which companies will receive additional capital and will expand—in the process, making and breaking fortunes. As in the Soviet Union in its heyday, China is growing rapidly, but this is still growth under extractive institutions, under the control of the state, with little sign of a transition to inclusive political institutions. The fact that Chinese economic institutions are still far from fully inclusive also suggests that a South Korean–style transition is less likely, though of course not impossible.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even though extractive institutions can generate some growth, they will usually not generate sustained economic growth, and certainly not the type of growth that is accompanied by creative destruction. When both political and economic institutions are extractive, the incentives will not be there for creative destruction and technological change. For a while the state may be able to create rapid economic growth by allocating resources and people by fiat, but this process is intrinsically limited. When the limits are hit, growth stops, as it did in the Soviet Union in the 1970s.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"when growth comes under extractive political institutions but where economic institutions have inclusive aspects, as they did in South Korea, there is always the danger that economic institutions become more extractive and growth stops. Those controlling political power will eventually find it more beneficial to use their power to limit competition, to increase their share of the pie, or even to steal and loot from others rather than support economic progress.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Almighty God uses thunder, lightening [sic], and other blows which issue from his throne to scourge the sons whom he wishes to redeem. Accordingly, since a catastrophic pestilence from the East has arrived in a neighboring kingdom, it is to be very much feared that, unless we pray devoutly and incessantly, a similar pestilence will stretch its poisonous branches into this realm, and strike down and consume the inhabitants. Therefore we must all come before the presence of the Lord in confession, reciting psalms.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The plague hit and quickly wiped out about half the English population. Such catastrophes can have a huge effect on the institutions of society. Perhaps understandably, scores of people went mad. Boccaccio noted that “some maintained that an infallible way of warding off this appalling evil was to drink heavily, enjoy life to the full, go round singing and merrymaking, gratify all one’s cravings whenever the opportunity offered, and shrug the thing off as an enormous joke . . . and this explains why those women who recovered were possibly less chaste in the period that followed.” Yet the plague also had a socially, economically, and politically transformative impact on medieval European societies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The massive scarcity of labor created by the plague shook the foundations of the feudal order. It encouraged peasants to demand that things change.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though in 1346 there were few differences between Western and Eastern Europe in terms of political and economic institutions, by 1600 they were worlds apart. In the West, workers were free of feudal dues, fines, and regulations and were becoming a key part of a booming market economy. In the East, they were also involved in such an economy, but as coerced serfs growing the food and agricultural goods demanded in the West. It was a market economy, but not an inclusive one.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Black Death is a vivid example of a critical juncture, a major event or confluence of factors disrupting the existing economic or political balance in society. A critical juncture is a double-edged sword that can cause a sharp turn in the trajectory of a nation. On the one hand it can open the way for breaking the cycle of extractive institutions and enable more inclusive ones to emerge, as in England. Or it can intensify the emergence of extractive institutions, as was the case with the Second Serfdom in Eastern Europe.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The culmination of the institutional struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were two landmark events: the English Civil War between 1642 and 1651, and particularly the Glorious Revolution of 1688.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Glorious Revolution limited the power of the king and the executive, and relocated to Parliament the power to determine economic institutions. At the same time, it opened up the political system to a broad cross section of society, who were able to exert considerable influence over the way the state functioned. The Glorious Revolution was the foundation for creating a pluralistic society, and it built on and accelerated a process of political centralization. It created the world’s first set of inclusive political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"is not a coincidence that the Industrial Revolution started in England a few decades following the Glorious Revolution. The great inventors such as James Watt (perfecter of the steam engine), Richard Trevithick (the builder of the first steam locomotive), Richard Arkwright (the inventor of the spinning frame), and Isambard Kingdom Brunel (the creator of several revolutionary steamships) were able to take up the economic opportunities generated by their ideas, were confident that their property rights would be respected, and had access to markets where their innovations could be profitably sold and used.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The events leading up to the Glorious Revolution forged a broad and powerful coalition able to place durable constraints on the power of the monarchy and the executive, which were forced to be open to the demands of this coalition. This laid the foundations for pluralistic political institutions, which then enabled the development of economic institutions that would underpin the first Industrial Revolution.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Spain this mattered little, because after 1492 the Spanish Crown had a vast American empire and benefited massively from the gold and silver found there. In England the situation was different. Elizabeth I was far less financially independent, so she had to beg Parliament for more taxes. In exchange, Parliament demanded concessions, in particular restrictions on the right of Elizabeth to create monopolies. It was a conflict Parliament gradually won. In Spain the Cortes lost a similar conflict. Trade wasn’t just monopolized; it was monopolized by the Spanish monarchy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Elizabeth I and her successors could not monopolize the trade with the Americas. Other European monarchs could. So while in England, Atlantic trade and colonization started creating a large group of wealthy traders with few links to the Crown, this was not the case in Spain or France. The English traders resented royal control and demanded changes in political institutions and the restriction of royal prerogatives. They played a critical role in the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. Similar conflicts took place everywhere. French kings, for example, faced the Fronde Rebellion between 1648 and 1652. The difference was that in England it was far more likely that the opponents to absolutism would prevail because they were relatively wealthy and more numerous than the opponents to absolutism in Spain and France.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though Indian merchants did trade throughout the Indian Ocean, and a major textile industry developed, the caste system and Mughal absolutism were serious impediments to the development of inclusive economic institutions in India. By the nineteenth century, things were even less hospitable for industrialization as India became an extractive colony of the English.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China was never formally colonized by a European power, but after the English successfully defeated the Chinese in the Opium Wars between 1839 and 1842, and then again between 1856 and 1860, China had to sign a series of humiliating treaties and allow European exports to enter.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"While Tokugawa rule in Japan was absolutist and extractive, it had only a tenuous hold on the leaders of the other major feudal domains and was susceptible to challenge. Even though there were peasant rebellions and civil strife, absolutism in China was stronger, and the opposition less organized and autonomous. There were no equivalents of the leaders of the other domains in China who could challenge the absolutist rule of the emperor and trace an alternative institutional path.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China continued in its absolutist path after the Opium Wars, while the U.S. threat cemented the opposition to Tokugawa rule in Japan and led to a political revolution, the Meiji Restoration,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1453 the Ottomans under Sultan Mehmet II captured Constantinople, making it their capital. During the rest of the century, the Ottomans conquered large parts of the Balkans and most of the rest of Turkey. In the first half of the sixteenth century, Ottoman rule spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. By 1566, at the death of Sultan Süleyman I, known as the Magnificent, their empire stretched from Tunisia in the East, through Egypt, all the way to Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula, and on to what is now modern Iraq. The Ottoman state was absolutist, with the sultan accountable to few and sharing power with none.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“Soviet Russia,” he recalled in his 1931 autobiography, “was a revolutionary government with an evolutionary plan. Their plan was not to end evils such as poverty and riches, graft, privilege, tyranny, and war by direct action, but to seek out and remove their causes. They had set up a dictatorship, supported by a small, trained minority, to make and maintain for a few generations a scientific rearrangement of economic forces which would result in economic democracy first and political democracy last.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Lenin had died in 1924, and by 1927 Joseph Stalin had consolidated his grip on the country. He purged his opponents and launched a drive to rapidly industrialize the country. He did it via energizing the State Planning Committee, Gosplan, which had been founded in 1921. Gosplan wrote the first Five-Year Plan, which ran between 1928 and 1933. Economic growth Stalin style was simple: develop industry by government command and obtain the necessary resources for this by taxing agriculture at very high rates.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The communist state did not have an effective tax system, so instead Stalin “collectivized” agriculture. This process entailed the abolition of private property rights to land and the herding of all people in the countryside into giant collective farms run by the Communist Party. This made it much easier for Stalin to grab agricultural output and use it to feed all the people who were building and manning the new factories. The consequences of this for the rural folk were calamitous. The collective farms completely lacked incentives for people to work hard, so production fell sharply. So much of what was produced was extracted that there was not enough to eat. People began to starve to death.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"fact, between 1928 and 1960 national income grew at 6 percent a year, probably the most rapid spurt of economic growth in history up until then. This quick economic growth was not created by technological change, but by reallocating labor and by capital accumulation through the creation of new tools and factories.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As late as 1977, a leading academic textbook by an English economist argued that Soviet-style economies were superior to capitalist ones in terms of economic growth, providing full employment and price stability and even in producing people with altruistic motivation. Poor old Western capitalism did better only at providing political freedom. Indeed, the most widely used university textbook in economics, written by Nobel Prize–winner Paul Samuelson, repeatedly predicted the coming economic dominance of the Soviet Union.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All plans were labeled “draft” or “preliminary.” Only one copy of a plan labeled “final”—that for light industry in 1939—has ever come to light. Stalin himself said in 1937 that “only bureaucrats can think that planning work ends with the creation of the plan. The\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If you made a decision that turned out badly, you might get shot. Better to avoid all responsibility.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Stalin’s response was to have those who organized the census arrested and sent to Siberia or shot. He ordered another census, which took place in 1939. This time the organizers got it right; they found that the population was actually 171 million.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Stalin understood that in the Soviet economy, people had few incentives to work hard. A natural response would have been to introduce such incentives, and sometimes he did—for example, by directing food supplies to areas where productivity had fallen—to reward improvements. Moreover, as early as 1931 he gave up on the idea of creating “socialist men and women” who would work without monetary incentives. In a famous speech he criticized “equality mongering,” and thereafter not only did different jobs get paid different wages but also a bonus system was introduced. It\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Unlike in a market economy, prices in the Soviet Union were set by the government, and thus bore little relation to value.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In June 1940, for example, a law made absenteeism, defined as any twenty minutes unauthorized absence or even idling on the job, a criminal offense that could be punished by six months’ hard labor and a 25 percent cut in pay.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though you can move someone to a factory, you cannot force people to think and have good ideas by threatening to shoot them. Coercion like this might have generated a high output of sugar in Barbados or Jamaica, but it could not compensate for the lack of incentives in a modern industrial economy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The fact that truly effective incentives could not be introduced in the centrally planned economy was not due to technical mistakes in the design of the bonus schemes. It was intrinsic to the whole method by which extractive growth had been achieved. It had been done by government command, which could solve some basic economic problems. But stimulating sustained economic growth required that individuals use their talent and ideas, and this could never be done with a Soviet-style economic system.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is a fundamental difference between farming and herding and hunting-gathering. The former is based on the domestication of plant and animal species, with active intervention in their life cycles to change genetics to make those species more useful to humans. Domestication is a technological change that enables humans to produce a lot more food from the available plants and animals.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The early growth of the Natufians did not become sustained for the same reason that Soviet growth fizzled out. Though highly significant, even revolutionary for its time, this was growth under extractive institutions. For the Natufian society it was also likely that this type of growth created deep conflicts over who would control institutions and the extraction they enabled.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Sometimes infighting simply replaces one elite with another. Sometimes it destroys the whole extractive society, unleashing a process of state and societal collapse, as the spectacular civilization that Maya city-states built more than one thousand years ago experienced.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Maya city-states in the area of southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Western Honduras in fact built a fairly sophisticated civilization under their own brand of extractive institutions. The Maya experience illustrates not only the possibility of growth under extractive institutions but also another fundamental limit to this type of growth: the political instability that emerges and ultimately leads to collapse of both society and state as different groups and people fight to become the extractors.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Maya cities first began to develop around 500 BC. These early cities eventually failed, sometime in the first century AD. A new political model then emerged, creating the foundation for the Classic Era, between AD 250 and 900. This period marked the full flowering of Maya culture and civilization. But this more sophisticated civilization would also collapse in the course of the next six hundred years. By the time the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the early sixteenth century, the great temples and palaces of such Maya sites as Tikal, Palenque, and Calakmul had receded into the forest, not to be rediscovered until the nineteenth century.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Mayas were skilled builders who independently invented cement. Their buildings and their inscriptions provide vital information on the trajectories of the Maya cities, as they often recorded events dated according to the Long Count.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Around AD 500 there are few dated monuments. For example, the Long Count date corresponding to AD 514 recorded just ten. There was then a steady increase, reaching twenty by AD 672 and forty by the middle of the eighth century. After this the number of dated monuments collapses. By the ninth century, it is down to ten per year, and by the tenth century, to zero.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the period AD 400–449, the population was negligible, estimated at about six hundred people. It rose steadily to a peak of twenty-eight thousand in AD 750–799. Though this does not appear large by contemporary urban standards, it was massive for that period; these numbers imply that in this period, Copán had a larger population than London or Paris. Other Maya cities, such as Tikal and Calakmul, were undoubtedly much larger. In line with the evidence from the Long Count dates, AD 800 was the population peak for Copán. After this it began to decline, and by AD 900 it had fallen to around fifteen thousand people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Maya’s economy was based on extensive occupational specialization, with skilled potters, weavers, woodworkers, and tool and ornament makers. They also traded obsidian, jaguar pelts, marine shells, cacao, salt, and feathers among themselves and other polities over long distances in Mexico. They probably had money, too, and like the Aztecs, used cacao beans for currency.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The overwhelming fact about the Maya collapse is that it coincides with the overthrow of the political model based on the k’uhul ajaw. We saw in Copán that after Yax Pasaj’s death in AD 810 there were no more kings.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"around this time the royal palaces were abandoned. Twenty miles to the north of Copán, in the city of Quiriguá, the last king, Jade Sky, ascended to the throne between AD 795 and 800. The last dated monument is from AD 810 by the Long Count, the same year that Yax Pasaj died. The city was abandoned soon after. Throughout the Maya area the story is the same; the political institutions that had provided the context for the expansion of trade, agriculture, and population vanished. Royal courts did not function, monuments and temples were not carved, and palaces were emptied. As political and social institutions unraveled, reversing the process of state centralization, the economy contracted and the population fell.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As these institutions create significant gains for the elite, there will be strong incentives for others to fight to replace the current elite. Infighting and instability are thus inherent features of extractive institutions, and they not only create further inefficiencies but also often reverse any political centralization, sometimes even leading to the total breakdown of law and order\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One of the key bases for the economic expansion of Venice was a series of contractual innovations making economic institutions much more inclusive.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The most famous was the commenda, a rudimentary type of joint stock company, which formed only for the duration of a single trading mission. A commenda involved two partners, a “sedentary” one who stayed in Venice and one who traveled. The sedentary partner put capital into the venture, while the traveling partner accompanied the cargo. Typically, the sedentary partner put in the lion’s share of the capital.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Studying official documents, one sees how powerful a force the commenda was in fostering upward social mobility: these documents are full of new names, people who had previously not been among the Venetian elite. In government documents of AD 960, 971, and 982, the number of new names comprise 69 percent, 81 percent, and 65 percent, respectively, of those recorded.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The debates and constitutional amendments of 1286 presaged La Serrata (“The Closure”) of Venice. In February 1297, it was decided that if you had been a member of the Great Council in the previous four years, you received automatic nomination and approval. New nominations now had to be approved by the Council of Forty, but with only twelve votes. After September 11, 1298, current members and their families no longer needed confirmation. The Great Council was now effectively sealed to outsiders, and the initial incumbents had become a hereditary aristocracy. The seal on this came in 1315, with the Libro d’Oro, or “Gold Book,” which was an official registry of the Venetian nobility.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Having implemented a political Serrata, the Great Council then moved to adopt an economic Serrata. The switch toward extractive political institutions was now being followed by a move toward extractive economic institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Most important, they banned the use of commenda contracts, one of the great institutional innovations that had made Venice rich. This shouldn’t be a surprise: the commenda benefited new merchants, and now the established elite was trying to exclude them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Another step came when, starting in 1314, the Venetian state began to take over and nationalize trade. It organized state galleys to engage in trade and, from 1324 on, began to charge individuals high levels of taxes if they wanted to engage in trade. Long-distance trade became the preserve of the nobility.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Venice appeared to have been on the brink of becoming the world’s first inclusive society, but it fell to a coup. Political and economic institutions became more extractive, and Venice began to experience economic decline. By 1500 the population had shrunk to one hundred thousand. Between 1650 and 1800, when the population of Europe rapidly expanded, that of Venice contracted. Today the only economy Venice has, apart from a bit of fishing, is tourism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"First, moves toward inclusive institutions, as our account of Venice shows, can be reversed. Venice became prosperous. But its political and economic institutions were overthrown, and that prosperity went into reverse. Today Venice is rich only because people who make their income elsewhere choose to spend it there admiring the glory of its past.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As in Venice, Rome’s initial economic success was based on inclusive institutions—at least by the standards of their time. As in Venice, these institutions became decidedly more extractive over time. With Rome, this was a consequence of the change from the Republic (510 BC–49 BC) to the Empire (49 BC–AD 476).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Roman citizens created the republic by overthrowing their king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, known as Tarquin the Proud, around 510 BC. The republic cleverly designed political institutions with many inclusive elements. It was governed by magistrates elected for a year. That the office of magistrate was elected, annually, and held by multiple people at the same time reduced the ability of any one person to consolidate or exploit his power. The republic’s institutions contained a system of checks and balances that distributed power fairly widely.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Roman growth was unsustainable, occurring under institutions that were partially inclusive and partially extractive. Though Roman citizens had political and economic rights, slavery was widespread and very extractive, and the elite, the senatorial class, dominated both the economy and politics. Despite the presence of the Plebeian Assembly and plebeian tribute, for example, real power rested with the Senate, whose members came from the large landowners constituting the senatorial class.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"According to the Roman historian Plutarch, Tiberius Gracchus, when traveling through Etruria, a region in what is now central Italy, became aware of the hardship that families of citizen-soldiers were suffering. Whether because of this experience or because of other frictions with the powerful senators of his time, he would soon embark upon a daring plan to change land allocation in Italy. He stood for plebeian tribune in 133 BC, then used his office to propose land reform: a commission would investigate whether public lands were being illegally occupied and would redistribute land in excess of the legal limit of three hundred acres to landless Roman citizens.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Things came to a head when Tiberius Gracchus claimed for his land reform commission the funds left by the king of the Greek city Pergamum to the Roman people. He also attempted to stand for tribune a second time, partly because he was afraid of persecution by the Senate after he stepped down. This gave the senators the pretext to charge that Tiberius was trying to declare himself king. He and his supporters were attacked, and many were killed. Tiberius Gracchus himself was one of the first to fall, though his death would not solve the problem, and others would attempt to reform the distribution of land and other aspects of Roman economy and society.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The political institutions forming the core of the Roman Republic were overthrown by Julius Caesar in 49 BC when he moved his legion across the Rubicon, the river separating the Roman provinces of Cisalpine Gaul from Italy. Rome fell to Caesar, and another civil war broke out. Though Caesar was victorious, he was murdered by disgruntled senators, led by Brutus and Cassius, in 44 BC.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since the end of the second century, civil war had become a fact of life in the Roman Empire. Between the death of Marcus Aurelius in AD 180 until the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476, there was hardly a decade that did not see a civil war or a palace coup against an emperor. Few emperors died of natural causes or in battle. Most were murdered by usurpers or their own troops.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"THE EARLY fifth century, the barbarians were literally at the gate. Some historians argue that it was a consequence of the more formidable opponents the Romans faced during the late Empire. But the success of the Goths, Huns, and Vandals against Rome was a symptom, not the cause, of Rome’s decline. During the Republic, Rome had dealt with much more organized and threatening opponents, such as the Carthaginians.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Rome’s increasingly extractive political and economic institutions generated its demise because they caused infighting and civil war. The origins of the decline go back at least to Augustus’s seizure of power, which set in motion changes that made political institutions much more extractive. These included changes in the structure of the army, which made secession impossible, thus removing a crucial element that ensured political representation for common Romans.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Equally important, as the empire developed, more and more agricultural workers were reduced to semi-servile status and tied to the land. The status of these servile “coloni” is extensively discussed in legal documents such as the Codex Theodosianus and Codex Justinianus, and probably originated during the reign of Diocletian (AD 284 to 305). The rights of landlords over the coloni were progressively increased. The emperor Constantine in 332 allowed landlords to chain a colonus whom they suspected was trying to escape, and from AD 365, coloni were not allowed to sell their own property without their landlord’s permission.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A remarkable thing about new technologies in the Roman period is that their creation and spread seem to have been driven by the state. This is good news, until the government decides that it is not interested in technological development—an all-too-common occurrence due to the fear of creative destruction.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Another important reason for the lack of technological innovation was the prevalence of slavery. As the territories Romans controlled expanded, vast numbers were enslaved, often being brought back to Italy to work on large estates. Many citizens in Rome did not need to work: they lived off the handouts from the government.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For instance, during the reduction of the rural population to the status of serfs, slavery disappeared from Europe. At a time when it was possible for elites to reduce the entire rural population to serfdom, it did not seem necessary to have a separate class of slaves as every previous society had had.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"How the Atlantic trade led to sharply divergent paths between Western Europe and Africa is yet another example of institutional divergence resulting from the interaction between critical junctures and existing institutional differences. While in England the profits of the slave trade helped to enrich those who opposed absolutism, in Africa they helped to create and strengthen absolutism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By the sixteenth century, Europe was institutionally very distinct from sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Though not much richer than the most spectacular Asian civilizations in India or China, Europe differed from these polities in some key ways. For example, it had developed representative institutions of a sort unseen there.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The fear of creative destruction is the main reason why there was no sustained increase in living standards between the Neolithic and Industrial revolutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Technological innovation makes human societies prosperous, but also involves the replacement of the old with the new, and the destruction of the economic privileges and political power of certain people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This intra-elite conflict ended with the War of the Roses, a long duel between the Houses of Lancaster and York, two families with contenders to be king. The winners were the Lancastrians, whose candidate for king, Henry Tudor, became Henry VII in 1485.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"His son, Henry VIII, then implemented through his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, a revolution in government. In the 1530s, Cromwell introduced a nascent bureaucratic state. Instead of the government being just the private household of the king, it could become a separate set of enduring institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Charles’s increasingly absolutist behavior and extractive policies created resentment and resistance throughout the country. In 1640 he faced conflict with Scotland and, without enough money to put a proper army into the field, was forced to call Parliament to ask for more taxes. The so-called Short Parliament sat for only three weeks. The parliamentarians who came to London refused to talk about taxes, but aired many grievances, until Charles dismissed them. The Scots realized that Charles did not have the support of the nation and invaded England, occupying the city of Newcastle.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, the Parliamentarians—known as the Roundheads after the style in which their hair was cropped—defeated the royalists, known as Cavaliers. Charles was tried and executed in 1649. His defeat and the abolition of the monarchy did not, however, result in inclusive institutions. Instead, monarchy was replaced by the dictatorship of Oliver Cromwell. Following Cromwell’s death, the monarchy was restored in 1660 and clawed back many of the privileges that had been stripped from it in 1649. Charles’s son, Charles II, then set about the same program of creating absolutism in England.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"These attempts were only intensified by his brother James II, who ascended to the throne after Charles’s death in 1685. In 1688 James’s attempt to reestablish absolutism created another crisis and another civil war. Parliament this time was more united and organized. They invited the Dutch Statholder, William of Orange, and his wife, Mary, James’s Protestant daughter, to replace James. William would bring an army and claim the throne, to rule not as an absolutist monarch but under a constitutional monarchy forged by Parliament. Two months after William’s landing in the British Isles at Brixham in Devon (see Map 9, page 112), James’s army disintegrated and he fled to France.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Declaration of Rights also asserted that the monarch could not suspend or dispense with laws, and it reiterated the illegality of taxation without parliamentary consent. In addition, it stated that there could be no standing army in England without parliamentary consent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even without specific constitutional rules or laws, William simply gave up on many of the practices of previous kings. He stopped interfering in legal decisions and gave up previous “rights,” such as getting the customs revenues for life. Taken together, these changes in political institutions represented the triumph of Parliament over the king, and thus the end of absolutism in England and subsequently Great Britain\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since many of those in Parliament had important investments in trade and industry, they had a strong stake in enforcing property rights. The Stuarts had frequently infringed on property rights; now they would be upheld. Moreover, when the Stuarts controlled how the government spent money, Parliament opposed greater taxes and balked at strengthening the power of the state.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Now that Parliament itself controlled spending, it was happy to raise taxes and spend the money on activities that it deemed valuable. Chief among them was the strengthening of the navy, which would protect the overseas mercantile interests of many of the members of Parliament.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Anybody could petition Parliament, and petition they did. Significantly, when people petitioned, Parliament listened. It is this more than anything that reflects the defeat of absolutism, the empowerment of a fairly broad segment of society, and the rise of pluralism in England after 1688.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though Charles II and James II could not bring these back, they managed to maintain the ability to grant overseas monopolies. One was the Royal African Company, whose monopoly charter was issued by Charles II in 1660. This company held a monopoly on the lucrative African slave trade, and its governor and major shareholder was Charles’s brother James, soon to become James II.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is one more significant change in institutions that emerged from the Glorious Revolution: Parliament continued the process of political centralization that was initiated by the Tudors. It was not just that constraints increased, or that the state regulated the economy in a different way, or that the English state spent money on different things; but also the capability and capacity of the state increased in all directions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The wool industry mounted attempts to protect itself as early as the 1660s. It promoted the “Sumptuary Laws,” which, among other things, prohibited the wearing of lighter cloth. It also lobbied Parliament to pass legislation in 1666 and 1678 that would make it illegal for someone to be buried in anything other than a woolen shroud.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Manchester Act of 1736 agreed that “great quantities of stuffs made from linen yarn and cotton wool have for several years past been manufactured, and have been printed and painted within this kingdom of Great Britain.” It then went on to assert that “nothing in the said recited Act [of 1721] shall extend or be construed to prohibit the wearing or using in apparel, household stuff, furniture or otherwise, any sort of stuff made out of linen yarn and cotton wool, manufactured and printed or painted with any colour or colours within the kingdom of Great Britain.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The effects of these innovations were truly revolutionary: earlier in the century, it took 50,000 hours for hand spinners to spin one hundred pounds of cotton. Arkwright’s water frame could do it in 300 hours, and the self-acting mule in 135.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Along with the mechanization of spinning came the mechanization of weaving.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The English textile industry not only was the driving force behind the Industrial Revolution but also revolutionized the world economy. English exports, led by cotton textiles, doubled between 1780 and 1800.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Only about one-fifth of the leading industrialists at this time had previously been involved in anything like manufacturing activities.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Creative destruction redistributes not simply income and wealth, but also political power, as William Lee learned when he found the authorities so unreceptive to his invention because they feared its political consequences.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As early as 1485 the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II issued an edict that Muslims were expressly forbidden from printing in Arabic. This rule was further reinforced by Sultan Selim I in 1515. It was not until 1727 that the first printing press was allowed in the Ottoman lands. Then Sultan Ahmed III issued a decree granting İbrahim Müteferrika permission to set up a press.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Müteferrika was allowed to set up a printing press, but whatever he printed had to be vetted by a panel of three religious and legal scholars, the Kadis. Maybe the wisdom and knowledge of the Kadis, like everybody else’s, would have increased much faster had the printing press been more readily available. But that was not to be, even after Müteferrika was given permission to set up his press.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This opposition to the printing press had the obvious consequences for literacy, education, and economic success. In 1800 probably only 2 to 3 percent of the citizens of the Ottoman Empire were literate, compared with 60 percent of adult males and 40 percent of adult females in England. In the Netherlands and Germany, literacy rates were even higher. The Ottoman lands lagged far behind the European countries with the lowest educational attainment in this period, such as Portugal, where probably only around 20 percent of adults could read and write.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Books spread ideas and make the population much harder to control. Some of these ideas may be valuable new ways to increase economic growth, but others may be subversive and challenge the existing political and social status quo.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The reason that the economic changes that took place in England did not happen in the Ottoman Empire is the natural connection between extractive, absolutist political institutions and extractive economic institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By the fifteenth century, it represented only eighteen cities, each of whom sent two deputies. In consequence, the Cortes did not represent as broad a set of groups as the English Parliament did, and it never developed as a nexus of diverse interests vying to place constraints on absolutism. It could not legislate, and even the scope of its powers with respect to taxation was limited. This all made it easier for the Spanish monarchy to sideline the Cortes in the process of consolidating its own absolutism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Charles V decided to present the Cortes with demands for increased taxation. Urban elites used the moment to call for much wider change in the Cortes and its powers. This opposition turned violent and quickly became known as the Comunero Rebellion. Charles was able to crush the rebellion with loyal troops.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“We do not desire at all that the great masses shall become well off and independent . . . How could we otherwise rule over them?”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Opposition to innovation was manifested in two ways. First, Francis I was opposed to the development of industry. Industry led to factories, and factories would concentrate poor workers in cities, particularly in the capital city of Vienna. Those workers might then become supporters for opponents of absolutism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He wanted to keep society primarily agrarian. The best way to do this, Francis believed, was to stop the factories being built in the first place. This he did directly—for instance, in 1802, banning the creation of new factories in Vienna. Instead of encouraging the importation and adoption of new machinery, the basis of industrialization, he banned it until 1811.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"he opposed the construction of railways, one of the key new technologies that came with the Industrial Revolution. When a plan to build a northern railway was put before Francis I, he replied, “No, no, I will have nothing to do with it, lest the revolution might come into the country.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The economic potential for railway development in the empire had been sensed early by the banker Salomon Rothschild, the representative in Vienna of the great banking family. Salomon’s brother Nathan, who was based in England, was very impressed by George Stephenson’s engine “The Rocket” and the potential for steam locomotion. He contacted his brother to encourage him to look for opportunities to develop railways in Austria, since he believed that the family could make large profits by financing railway development. Nathan agreed, but the scheme went nowhere because Emperor Francis again simply said no.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The radical philosopher Peter Kropotkin, one of the founders of modern anarchism, left a vivid depiction of the way serfdom worked during the reign of Tsar Nicholas I, who ruled Russia from 1825 until 1855. He recalled from his childhood stories of men and women torn from their families and their villages and sold, lost in gambling, or exchanged for a couple of hunting dogs, and transported to some remote part of Russia . . . of children taken from their parents and sold to cruel or dissolute masters; of flogging “in the stables,” which occurred every day with unheard of cruelty; of a girl who found her only salvation in drowning herself; of an old man who had grown grey-haired in his master’s service and at last hanged himself under his master’s window; and of revolts of serfs, which were suppressed by Nicholas I’s generals by flogging to death each tenth or fifth man taken out of the ranks, and by laying waste the village . . . As to the poverty which I saw during our journeys in certain villages, especially in those which belonged to the imperial family, no words would be adequate to describe the misery to readers who have not seen it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Urged on by Nicholas, Kankrin took specific steps to slow the potential for industry. He banned several industrial exhibitions, which had previously been held periodically to showcase new technology and facilitate technology adoption.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Opposition to railways accompanied opposition to industry, exactly as in Austria-Hungary. Before 1842 there was only one railway in Russia. This was the Tsarskoe Selo Railway, which ran seventeen miles from Saint Petersburg to the imperial residencies of Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk. Just as Kankrin opposed industry, he saw no reason to promote railways, which he argued would bring a socially dangerous mobility, noting that “railways do not always result from natural necessity, but are more an object of artificial need or luxury. They encourage unnecessary travel from place to place, which is entirely typical of our time.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kankrin turned down numerous bids to build railways, and it was only in 1851 that a line was built linking Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Kankrin’s policy was continued by Count Kleinmichel, who was made head of the main administration of Transport and Public Buildings.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Under the Song dynasty, between 960 and 1279, China led the world in many technological innovations. The Chinese invented clocks, the compass, gunpowder, paper and paper money, porcelain, and blast furnaces to make cast iron before Europe did. They independently developed spinning wheels and waterpower at more or less the same time that these emerged at the other end of Eurasia. In consequence, in 1500 standards of living were probably at least as high in China as they were in Europe. For centuries China also had a centralized state with a meritocratically recruited civil service.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Merchants always had a precarious status in China, and the great inventions of the Song were not spurred by market incentives but were brought into existence under the auspices, or even the orders, of the government. Little of this was commercialized. The grip of the state tightened during the Ming and Qing dynasties that followed the Song. At the root of all this was the usual logic of extractive institutions. As most rulers presiding over extractive institutions, the absolutist emperors of China opposed change, sought stability, and in essence feared creative destruction.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In China, while private merchants were commonly involved in trade within the country, the state monopolized overseas trade.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1402 Emperor Yongle came to the throne and initiated one of the most famous periods of Chinese history by restarting government-sponsored foreign trade on a big scale. Yongle sponsored Admiral Zheng He to undertake six huge missions to Southeast and South Asia, Arabia, and Africa. The Chinese knew about these places from a long history of trading relations, but nothing had ever happened on this scale before. The first fleet included 27,800 men and 62 large treasure ships, accompanied by 190 smaller ships, including ones specifically for carrying freshwater, others for supplies, and others for troops. Yet Emperor Yongle put a temporary stop on the missions after the sixth one in 1422. This was made permanent by his successor, Hongxi, who ruled from 1424 to 1425. Hongxi’s\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Just at the time when international trade and the discovery of the Americas were fundamentally transforming the institutions of England, China was cutting itself off from this critical juncture and turning inward.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1661 the emperor Kangxi ordered that all people living along the coast from Vietnam to Chekiang—essentially the entire southern coast, once the most commercially active part of China—should move seventeen miles inland. The coast was patrolled by troops to enforce the measure, and until 1693 there was a ban on shipping everywhere on the coast.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The reasoning of the Ming and Qing states for opposing international trade is by now familiar: the fear of creative destruction. The leaders’ primary aim was political stability. International trade was potentially destabilizing as merchants were enriched and emboldened, as they were in England during the era of Atlantic expansion.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Somalia, situated in the Horn of Africa, illustrates the devastating effects of lack of political centralization. Somalia has been dominated historically by people organized into six clan families. The four largest of these, the Dir, Darod, Isaq, and Hawiye, all trace their ancestry back to a mythical ancestor, Samaale.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the south, the Digil and the Rahanweyn, sedentary agriculturalists, make up the last two of the clan families.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Somalis identify first with their clan family, but these are very large and contain many subgroups. First among these are clans that trace their descent back to one of the larger clan families. More significant are the groupings within clans called diya-paying groups, which consist of closely related kinspeople who pay and collect diya, or “blood wealth,” compensation against the murder of one of their members.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Political power was very widely dispersed, with every Somali adult man being able to have his say on decisions that might affect the clan or group. This was achieved through an informal council made up of all adult males. There was no written law, no police, and no legal system to speak of, except that Sharia law was used as a framework within which informal laws were embedded.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We do not know what the path of economic and political development of Southeast Asian states would have been without Dutch aggression. They may have developed their own brand of absolutism, they may have remained in the same state they were in at the end of the sixteenth century, or they may have continued their commercialization by gradually adopting more and more inclusive institutions. But as in the Moluccas, Dutch colonialism fundamentally changed their economic and political development. The people in Southeast Asia stopped trading, turned inward, and became more absolutist. In the next two centuries, they would be in no position to take advantage of the innovations that would spring up in the Industrial Revolution. And ultimately their retreat from trade would not save them from Europeans; by the end of the eighteenth century, nearly all were part of European colonial empires.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the Roman period slaves came from Slavic peoples around the Black Sea, from the Middle East, and also from Northern Europe. But by 1400, Europeans had stopped enslaving each other.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The law also became a tool of enslavement. No matter what crime you committed, the penalty was slavery. The English merchant Francis Moore observed the consequences of this along the Senegambia coast of West Africa in the 1730s: Since this slave trade has been us’d, all punishments are changed into slavery; there being an advantage on such condemnations, they strain for crimes very hard, in order to get the benefit of selling the criminal. Not only murder, theft and adultery, are punished by selling the criminal for slave, but every trifling case is punished in the same manner.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The historian Patrick Manning estimates that the population of those areas of West and West-Central Africa that provided slaves for export was around twenty-two to twenty-five million in the early eighteenth century. On the conservative assumption that during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries these areas would have experienced a rate of population growth of about half a percent a year without the slave trade, Manning estimated that the population of this region in 1850 ought to have been at least forty-six to fifty-three million. In fact, it was about one-half of this.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Just as African societies took aggressive advantage of the economic opportunities presented by the slave trade, they did the same with legitimate commerce. But they did so in a peculiar context, one in which slavery was a way of life but the external demand for slaves had suddenly dried up. What were all these slaves to do now that they could not be sold to Europeans? The answer was simple: they could be profitably put to work, under coercion, in Africa, producing the new items of legitimate commerce.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the abolition of the slave trade, rather than making slavery in Africa wither away, simply led to a redeployment of the slaves, who were now used within Africa rather than in the Americas. Moreover, many of the political institutions the slave trade had wrought in the previous two centuries were unaltered and patterns of behavior persisted.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"slavery, rather than contracting, appears to have expanded in Africa throughout the nineteenth century. Though accurate figures are hard to come by, a number of existing accounts written by travelers and merchants during this time suggest that in the West African kingdoms of Asante and Dahomey and in the Yoruba city-states well over half of the population were slaves.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"World inequality today exists because during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some nations were able to take advantage of the Industrial Revolution and the technologies and methods of organization that it brought while others were unable to do so.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Technological change is only one of the engines of prosperity, but it is perhaps the most critical one. The countries that did not take advantage of new technologies did not benefit from the other engines of prosperity, either.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The story of one of the oldest civilizations in Asia, India, is similar, though the reversing of development was done not by the Dutch but by the British. India was the largest producer and exporter of textiles in the world in the eighteenth century. Indian calicoes and muslins flooded the European markets and were traded throughout Asia and even eastern Africa. The main agent that carried them to the British Isles was the English East India Company. Founded in 1600, two years before its Dutch version, the English East India Company spent the seventeenth century trying to establish a monopoly on the valuable exports from India. It had to compete with the Portuguese, who had bases in Goa, Chittagong, and Bombay, and the French with bases at Pondicherry, Chandernagore, Yanam, and Karaikal. Worse still for the East India Company was the Glorious Revolution, as we saw in chapter 7. The monopoly of the East India Company had been granted by the Stuart kings and was immediately challenged\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1856 the state of Victoria, which had been carved out of New South Wales in 1851, and the state of Tasmania would become the first places in the world to introduce an effective secret ballot in elections, which stopped vote buying and coercion. Today we still call the standard method of achieving secrecy in voting in elections the Australian ballot.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"AUSTRALIA, LIKE THE UNITED STATES, experienced a different path to inclusive institutions than the one taken by England. The same revolutions that shook England during the Civil War and then the Glorious Revolution were not needed in the United States or Australia because of the very different circumstances in which those countries were founded—though this of course does not mean that inclusive institutions were established without any conflict, and, in the process, the United States had to throw off British colonialism. In England there was a long history of absolutist rule that was deeply entrenched and required a revolution to remove it. In the United States and Australia, there was no such thing. Though Lord Baltimore in Maryland and John Macarthur in New South Wales might have aspired to such a role, they could not establish a strong enough grip on society for their plans to bear fruit. The inclusive institutions established in the United States and Australia meant that the Industrial Revolution spread quickly to these lands and they began to get rich. The path these countries took was followed by colonies such as Canada and New Zealand.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The leaders of the French Revolution and, subsequently, Napoleon exported the revolution to these lands, destroying absolutism, ending feudal land relations, abolishing guilds, and imposing equality before the law—the all-important notion of rule of law, which we will discuss in greater detail in the next chapter. The French Revolution thus prepared not only France but much of the rest of Europe for inclusive institutions and the economic growth that these would spur.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"French armies wrought much suffering in Europe, but they also radically changed the lay of the land. In much of Europe, gone were feudal relations; the power of the guilds; the absolutist control of monarchs and princes; the grip of the clergy on economic, social, and political power; and the foundation of ancien régime, which treated different people unequally based on their birth status. These changes created the type of inclusive economic institutions that would then allow industrialization to take root in these places. By the middle of the nineteenth century, industrialization was rapidly under way in almost all the places that the French controlled, whereas places such as Austria-Hungary and Russia, which the French did not conquer, or Poland and Spain, where French hold was temporary and limited, were still largely stagnant.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Shogun Yoshinobu agreed to resign, and on January 3, 1868, the Meiji Restoration was declared; Emperor Kōmei and, one month later after Kōmei died, his son Meiji were restored to power.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On January 27 the former shogun Yoshinobu attacked Satsuma and Chōshū forces, and civil war broke out; it raged until the summer, when finally the Tokugawas were vanquished.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is no-one more decided against annual Parliaments, universal suffrage and the ballot, than I am. My object is not to favour, but to put an end to such hopes and projects... The principle of my reform is, to prevent the necessity of revolution... reforming to preserve and not to overthrow.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The end of the U.S. Civil War initiated a rapid spurt of economic growth in the North. As railways, industry, and commerce expanded, a few people made vast fortunes. Emboldened by their economic success, these men and their companies became increasingly unscrupulous. They were called the Robber Barons because of their hard-nosed business practices aimed at consolidating monopolies and preventing any potential competitor from entering the market or doing business on an equal footing. One of the most notorious of these was Cornelius Vanderbilt, who famously remarked, “What do I care about the Law? Hain’t I got the power?”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Another was John D. Rockefeller, who started the Standard Oil Company in 1870. He quickly eliminated rivals in Cleveland and attempted to monopolize the transportation and retailing of oil and oil products. By 1882 he had created a massive monopoly—in the language of the day, a trust. By 1890 Standard Oil controlled 88 percent of the refined oil flows in the United States, and Rockefeller became the world’s first billionaire in 1916. Contemporary cartoons depict Standard Oil as an octopus wrapping itself around not just the oil industry but also Capitol Hill.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Almost as infamous was John Pierpont Morgan, the founder of the modern banking conglomerate J.P. Morgan, which later, after many mergers over decades, eventually became JPMorgan Chase. Along with Andrew Carnegie, Morgan founded the U.S. Steel Company in 1901, the first corporation with a capitalized value of more than $1 billion and by far the largest steel corporation in the world. In the 1890s, large trusts began to emerge in nearly every sector of the economy, and many of them controlled more than 70 percent of the market in their sector. These included several household names, such as Du Pont, Eastman Kodak, and International Harvester.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The apogee of Progressive reforms came with the election of Woodrow Wilson in 1912. Wilson noted in his 1913 book, The New Freedom,“If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of government. I do not expect to see monopoly restrain itself. If there are men in this country big enough to own the government of the United States, they are going to own it.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The rise of Robber Barons and their monopoly trusts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries underscores that, as we already emphasized in chapter 3, the presence of markets is not by itself a guarantee of inclusive institutions. Markets can be dominated by a few firms, charging exorbitant prices and blocking the entry of more efficient rivals and new technologies. Markets, left to their own devices, can cease to be inclusive, becoming increasingly dominated by the economically and politically powerful.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inclusive economic institutions require not just markets, but inclusive markets that create a level playing field and economic opportunities for the majority of the people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inclusive political institutions allow a free media to flourish, and a free media, in turn, makes it more likely that threats against inclusive economic and political institutions will be widely known and resisted. In contrast, such freedom is impossible under extractive political institutions, under absolutism, or under dictatorships, which helps extractive regimes to prevent serious opposition from forming in the first place.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One of the key pillars of the New Deal was the National Industrial Recovery Act. Title I focused on industrial recovery. President Roosevelt and his team believed that restraining industrial competition, giving workers greater rights to form trade unions, and regulating working standards were crucial to the recovery effort.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Title II established the Public Works Administration, whose infrastructure projects include such landmarks as the Thirtieth Street railroad station in Philadelphia, the Triborough Bridge, the Grand Coulee Dam, and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Roosevelt had moved to the next step of his agenda and had signed the Social Security Act, which introduced the modern welfare state into the United States: pensions at retirement, unemployment benefits, aid to families with dependent children, and some public health care and disability benefits.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It was in the immediate interests of the Democratic Congress and Senate to pack the court and ensure that all New Deal legislation survived. But in the same way that British political elites in the early eighteenth century understood that suspending the rule of law would endanger the gains they had wrested from the monarchy, congressmen and senators understood that if the president could undermine the independence of the judiciary, then this would undermine the balance of power in the system that protected them from the president and ensured the continuity of pluralistic political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Shortly after Perón’s victory, his supporters in the Chamber of Deputies proposed the impeachment of four of the five members of the Court. The charges leveled against the Court were several. One involved unconstitutionally accepting the legality of two military regimes in 1930 and 1943—rather ironic, since Perón had played a key role in the latter coup. The other focused on legislation that the court had struck down, just as its U.S. counterpart had done. In particular, just prior to Perón’s election as president, the Court had issued a decision ruling that Perón’s new national labor relations board was unconstitutional. Just as Roosevelt heavily criticized the Supreme Court in his 1936 reelection campaign, Perón did the same in his 1946 campaign. Nine months after initiating the impeachment process, the Chamber of Deputies impeached three of the judges, the fourth having already resigned. The Senate approved the motion. Perón then appointed four new justices. The undermining of the Court clearly had the effect of freeing Perón from political constraints. He could now exercise unchecked power, in much the same way the military regimes in Argentina did before and after his presidency. His newly appointed judges, for example, ruled as constitutional the conviction of Ricardo Balbín, the leader of the main opposition party to Perón, the Radical Party, for disrespecting Perón. Perón could effectively rule as a dictator.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since Perón successfully packed the Court, it has become the norm in Argentina for any new president to handpick his own Supreme Court justices.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Diamonds were discovered in Kono in eastern Sierra Leone in January 1930. The diamonds were alluvial, that is, not in deep mines. So the primary method of mining them was by panning in rivers. Some social scientists call these “democratic diamonds,” because they allow many people to become involved in mining, creating a potentially inclusive opportunity. Not so in Sierra Leone. Happily ignoring the intrinsically democratic nature of panning for diamonds, the British government set up a monopoly for the entire protectorate, called it the Sierra Leone Selection Trust, and granted it to De Beers, the giant South African diamond mining company. In 1936 De Beers was also given the right to create the Diamond Protection Force, a private army that would become larger than that of the colonial government in Sierra Leone.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Sierra Leone’s development, or lack thereof, could be best understood as the outcome of the vicious circle. British colonial authorities built extractive institutions in the first place, and the postindependence African politicians were only too happy to take up the baton for themselves. The pattern was eerily similar all over sub-Saharan Africa. There were similar hopes for postindependence Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, and many other African countries. Yet in all these cases, extractive institutions were re-created in a pattern predicted by the vicious circle—only they became more vicious as time went by. In all these countries, for example, the British creation of marketing boards and indirect rule were sustained.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Extractive political institutions lead to extractive economic institutions, which enrich a few at the expense of many. Those who benefit from extractive institutions thus have the resources to build their (private) armies and mercenaries, to buy their judges, and to rig their elections in order to remain in power.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Under extractive political institutions, there is little check against the exercise of power, however distorted and sociopathic it may become. In 1980 Sam Bangura, then the governor of the central bank in Sierra Leone, criticized Siaka Stevens’s policies for being profligate. He was soon murdered and thrown from the top floor of the central bank building onto the aptly named Siaka Stevens Street. Extractive political institutions thus also tend to create a vicious circle because they provide no line of defense against those who want to further usurp and misuse the powers of the state.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"extractive institutions, by creating unconstrained power and great income inequality, increase the potential stakes of the political game. Because whoever controls the state becomes the beneficiary of this excessive power and the wealth that it generates, extractive institutions create incentives for infighting in order to control power and its benefits, a dynamic that we saw played out in Maya city-states and in Ancient Rome. In this light, it is no surprise that the extractive institutions that many African countries inherited from the colonial powers sowed the seeds of power struggles and civil wars.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"These struggles would be very different conflicts from the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. They would not be fought to change political institutions, introduce constraints on the exercise of power, or create pluralism, but to capture power and enrich one group at the expense of the rest. In Angola, Burundi, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Republic of Congo Brazzaville, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda, and of course in Sierra Leone,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Coffee production needed land and labor. To create land for coffee farms, the Liberals pushed through land privatization, in fact really a land grab in which they would be able to capture land previously held communally or by the government. Though their attempt was bitterly contested, given the highly extractive political institutions and the concentration of political power in Guatemala, the elite were ultimately victorious. Between 1871 and 1883 nearly one million acres of land, mostly indigenous communal land and frontier lands, passed into the hands of the elite, and it was only then that coffee developed rapidly. The aim was the formation of large estates. The privatized lands were auctioned off typically to members of the traditional elite or those connected with them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Solomonic dynasty in Ethiopia lasted until it was overthrown by a military coup in 1974. The coup was led by the Derg, a group of Marxist army officers. The regime that the Derg pitched from power looked like it was frozen in some earlier century, a historical anachronism. The emperor Haile Selassie would start his day by arriving in the courtyard at the Grand Palace, which had been built by Emperor Menelik II in the late nineteenth century. Outside the palace would be a crowd of dignitaries anticipating his arrival, bowing and desperately trying to get his attention. The emperor would hold court in the Audience Hall, sitting on the imperial throne. (Selassie was a small man; so that his legs were not left swinging in the air, it was the job of a special pillow bearer to accompany him wherever he went to make sure there was a suitable pillow to put under his feet. The bearer kept a stock of fifty-two pillows to cope with any situation.) Selassie presided over an extreme set of extractive institutions and ran the country as his own private property, handing out favors and patronage and ruthlessly punishing lack of loyalty. There was no economic development to speak of in Ethiopia under the Solomonic dynasty.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The real Mengistu emerged: vengeful, cruel and authoritarian... Many of us who used to talk to him with hands in our pockets, as if he were one of us, found ourselves standing stiffly to attention, cautiously respectful in his presence. In addressing him we had always used the familiar form of “you,” ante; now we found ourselves switching to the more formal “you,” ersiwo. He moved into a bigger, more lavish office in the Palace of Menelik . . . He began using the Emperor’s cars... We were supposed to have a revolution of equality; now he had become the new Emperor.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The pattern of vicious circle depicted by the transition between Haile Selassie and Mengistu, or between the British colonial governors of Sierra Leone and Siaka Stevens, is so extreme and at some level so strange that it deserves a special name.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The essence of the iron law of oligarchy, this particular facet of the vicious circle, is that new leaders overthrowing old ones with promises of radical change bring nothing but more of the same. At some level, the iron law of oligarchy is harder to understand than other forms of the vicious circle. There is a clear logic to the persistence of the extractive institutions in the U.S. South and in Guatemala. The same groups continued to dominate the economy and the politics for centuries.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Rich nations are rich largely because they managed to develop inclusive institutions at some point during the past three hundred years. These institutions have persisted through a process of virtuous circles.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The most common reason why nations fail today is because they have extractive institutions. Zimbabwe under Mugabe’s regime vividly illustrates the economic and social consequences.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"After independence, Mugabe quickly established his personal control. He either violently eliminated his opponents or co-opted them. The most egregious acts of violence happened in Matabeleland, the heartland of support for ZAPU, where as many as twenty thousand people were killed in the early 1980s. By 1987 ZAPU had merged with ZANU to create ZANU-PF, and Joshua Nkomo was sidelined politically. Mugabe was able to rewrite the constitution he had inherited as a part of the independence negotiation, making himself president (he had started as prime minister), abolishing white voter rolls that were part of the independence agreement, and eventually, in 1990, getting rid of the Senate altogether and introducing positions in the legislature that he could nominate. A de facto one-party state headed by Mugabe was the result.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"NATIONS FAIL TODAY because their extractive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and innovate.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Sierra Leone during her bloody civil war of ten years, from 1991 to 2001, was a typical case of a failed state. It started out as just another country marred by extractive institutions, albeit of a particularly vicious and inefficient type. Countries become failed states not because of their geography or their culture, but because of the legacy of extractive institutions, which concentrate power and wealth in the hands of those controlling the state, opening the way for unrest, strife, and civil war. Extractive institutions also directly contribute to the gradual failing of the state by neglecting investment in the most basic public services, exactly what happened in Sierra Leone.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On December 1, 2001, the government froze all bank accounts, initially for ninety days. Only a small amount of cash was allowed for withdrawal on a weekly basis. First it was 250 pesos, still worth $250; then 300 pesos. But this was allowed to be withdrawn only from peso accounts. Nobody was allowed to withdraw money from their dollar accounts, unless they agreed to convert the dollars into pesos. Nobody wanted to do so. Argentines dubbed this situation El Corralito, “the Little Corral”: depositors were hemmed into a corral like cows, with nowhere to go. In January the devaluation was finally enacted, and instead of there being one peso for one dollar, there were soon four pesos for one dollar. This should have been a vindication of those who thought that they should put their savings in dollars. But it wasn’t, because the government then forcibly converted all the dollar bank accounts into pesos, but at the old one-for-one exchange rate. Someone who had had $1,000 saved suddenly found himself with only $250. The government had expropriated three-quarters of people’s savings.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"That elections have not brought either inclusive political or economic institutions is the typical case in Latin America. In Colombia, paramilitaries can fix one-third of national elections. In Venezuela today, as in Argentina, the democratically elected government of Hugo Chávez attacks its opponents, fires them from public-sector jobs, closes down newspapers whose editorials it doesn’t like, and expropriates property. In whatever he does, Chávez is much more powerful and less constrained than Sir Robert Walpole was in Britain in the 1720s, when he was unable to condemn John Huntridge under the Black Act (pages 302–308). Huntridge would have fared much less well in present-day Venezuela or Argentina.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is impossible to understand many of the poorest regions of the world at the end of the twentieth century without understanding the new absolutism of the twentieth century: communism. Marx’s vision was a system that would generate prosperity under more humane conditions and without inequality. Lenin and his Communist Party were inspired by Marx, but the practice could not have been more different from the theory. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was a bloody affair, and there was no humane aspect to it. Equality was not part of the equation, either, since the first thing Lenin and his entourage did was to create a new elite, themselves, at the head of the Bolshevik Party.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But the real tragedies were yet to come: first with the Civil War, and then under Stalin’s collectivization and his all-too-frequent purges, which may have killed as many as forty million people. Russian communism was brutal, repressive, and bloody, but not unique. The economic consequences and the human suffering were quite typical of what happened elsewhere—for example, in Cambodia in the 1970s under the Khmer Rouge, in China, and in North Korea.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In all cases communism brought vicious dictatorships and widespread human rights abuses. Beyond the human suffering and carnage, the communist regimes all set up various types of extractive institutions. The economic institutions, with or without markets, were designed to extract resources from the people, and by entirely abhorring property rights, they often created poverty instead of prosperity. In the Soviet case, as we saw in chapter 5, the Communist system at first generated rapid growth, but then faltered and led to stagnation. The consequences were much more devastating in China under Mao, in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, and in North Korea, where the Communist economic institutions led to economic collapse and famine.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The solution to the economic and political failure of nations today is to transform their extractive institutions toward inclusive ones. The vicious circle means that this is not easy. But it is not impossible, and the iron law of oligarchy is not inevitable. Either some preexisting inclusive elements in institutions, or the presence of broad coalitions leading the fight against the existing regime, or just the contingent nature of history, can break vicious circles.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The attempts at industrialization turned into the infamous Great Leap Forward after 1958 with the roll-out of the second five-year plan. Mao announced that steel output would double in a year based on small-scale “backyard” blast furnaces. He claimed that in fifteen years, China would catch up with British steel production. The only problem was that there was no feasible way of meeting these targets. To meet the plan’s goals, scrap metal had to be found, and people would have to melt down their pots and pans and even their agricultural implements such as hoes and plows. Workers who ought to have been tending the fields were making steel by destroying their plows, and thus their future ability to feed themselves and the country. The result was a calamitous famine in the Chinese countryside. Though scholars debate the role of Mao’s policy compared with the impact of droughts at the same time, nobody doubts the central role of the Great Leap Forward in contributing to the death of between twenty and forty million people. We don’t know precisely how many, because China under Mao did not collect the numbers that would have documented the atrocities. Per capita income fell by around one-quarter.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Soon the Cultural Revolution, just like the Great Leap Forward, would start wrecking both the economy and many human lives. Units of Red Guards were formed across the country: young, enthusiastic members of the Communist Party who were used to purge opponents of the regime. Many people were killed, arrested, or sent into internal exile. Mao himself retorted to concerns about the extent of the violence, stating, “This man Hitler was even more ferocious. The more ferocious, the better, don’t you think? The more people you kill, the more revolutionary you are.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1985 the mandatory state purchasing of grain was abandoned and replaced by a system of more voluntary contracts. Administrative control of agricultural prices was greatly relaxed in 1985.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There should be little doubt that in fifty or even a hundred years, the United States and Western Europe, based on their inclusive economic and political institutions, will be richer, most likely considerably richer, than sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Central America, or Southeast Asia.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Journalist Richard McGregor reports that on the desk of the head of each of the biggest state companies in China stands a red phone. When it rings, it is the party calling with orders on what the company should do, where it should invest, and what its targets will be. These giant companies are still under the command of the party, a fact we are reminded of when the party decides to shuffle their chief executives, fire them, or promote them, with little explanation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Just as in the Soviet Union, the Chinese experience of growth under extractive political institutions is greatly facilitated because there is a lot of catching up to do. Income per capita in China is still a fraction of that in the United States and Western Europe. Of course, Chinese growth is considerably more diversified than Soviet growth; it doesn’t rely on only armaments or heavy industry, and Chinese entrepreneurs are showing a lot of ingenuity. All the same, this growth will run out of steam unless extractive political institutions make way for inclusive institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China has thus achieved economic growth not thanks to its extractive political institutions, but despite them: its successful growth experience over the last three decades is due to a radical shift away from extractive economic institutions and toward significantly more inclusive economic institutions, which was made more difficult, not easier, by the presence of highly authoritarian, extractive political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Recent U.S. attitudes toward China, for example, have been shaped by this theory. George H. W. Bush summarized U.S. policy toward Chinese democracy as “Trade freely with China and time is on our side.” The idea was that as China traded freely with the West, it would grow, and that growth would bring democracy and better institutions in China, as modernization theory predicted. Yet the rapid increase in U.S.-China trade since the mid-1980s has done little for Chinese democracy, and the even closer integration that is likely to follow during the next decade will do equally little.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"First, growth under authoritarian, extractive political institutions in China, though likely to continue for a while yet, will not translate into sustained growth, supported by truly inclusive economic institutions and creative destruction. Second, contrary to the claims of modernization theory, we should not count on authoritarian growth leading to democracy or inclusive political institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Third, authoritarian growth is neither desirable nor viable in the long run, and thus should not receive the endorsement of the international community as a template for nations in Latin America, Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, even if it is a path that many nations will choose precisely because it is sometimes consistent with the interests of the economic and political elites dominating them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The first, often advocated by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, recognizes that poor development is caused by bad economic policies and institutions, and then proposes a list of improvements these international organizations attempt to induce poor countries to adopt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Attempts by international institutions to engineer economic growth by hectoring poor countries into adopting better policies and institutions are not successful because they do not take place in the context of an explanation of why bad policies and institutions are there in the first place, except that the leaders of poor countries are ignorant. The consequence is that the policies are not adopted and not implemented, or are implemented in name only.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Zimbabwe’s president Mugabe decided to heed international advice; he declared the Zimbabwean central bank independent in 1995. Before this, the inflation rate in Zimbabwe was hovering around 20 percent. By 2002 it had reached 140 percent; by 2003, almost 600 percent; by 2007, 66,000 percent; and by 2008, 230 million percent! Of course, in a country where the president wins the lottery (pages 368–373), it should surprise nobody that passing a law making the central bank independent means nothing.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What this episode illustrates is a micro version of the difficulty of implementing meaningful changes when institutions are the cause of the problems in the first place. In this case, it was not corrupt politicians or powerful businesses undermining institutional reform, but rather, the local health administration and nurses who were able to sabotage Seva Mandir’s and the development economists’ incentive scheme. This suggests that many of the micro-market failures that are apparently easy to fix may be illusory: the institutional structure that creates market failures will also prevent implementation of interventions to improve incentives at the micro level. Attempting to engineer prosperity without confronting the root cause of the problems—extractive institutions and the politics that keeps them in place—is unlikely to bear fruit.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As we have seen, democracy is no guarantee that there will be pluralism. The contrast of the development of pluralistic institutions in Brazil to the Venezuelan experience is telling in this context. Venezuela also transitioned to democracy after 1958, but this happened without empowerment at the grass-roots level and did not create a pluralistic distribution of political power. Instead, corrupt politics, patronage networks, and conflict persisted in Venezuela, and in part as a result, when voters went to the polls, they were even willing to support potential despots such as Hugo Chávez, most likely because they thought he alone could stand up to the established elites of Venezuela. In consequence, Venezuela still languishes under extractive institutions, while Brazil broke the mold.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Authoritarian regimes are often aware of the importance of a free media, and do their best to fight it. An extreme illustration of this comes from Alberto Fujimori’s rule in Peru. Though originally democratically elected, Fujimori soon set up a dictatorial regime in Peru, mounting a coup while still in office in 1992. Thereafter, though elections continued, Fujimori built a corrupt regime and ruled through repression and bribery. In this he relied heavily on his right-hand man, Valdimiro Montesinos, who headed the powerful national intelligence service of Peru. Montesinos was an organized man, so he kept good records of how much the administration paid different individuals to buy their loyalty, even videotaping many actual acts of bribery.\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/FHrju6kbzZ9tw2QaTonOV.html","relUrl":"notes/FHrju6kbzZ9tw2QaTonOV.html"},{"doc":"The Three-Body Problem","title":"The Three-Body Problem","hpath":"kindle_highlights.the_three_body_problem","content":"\n\"In the shooter hypothesis, a good marksman shoots at a target, creating a hole every ten centimeters.

He is, by any definition, rich. But say he plays on the same team as Mike Trout, who has a 12-year, $430 million contract. By comparison, the rookie is broke. But then think about Mike Trout. Thirty-six million dollars per year is an insane amount of money. But to make it on the list of the top-ten highest-paid hedge fund managers in 2018 you needed to earn at least $340 million in one year.14 That’s who people like Trout might compare their incomes to. And the hedge fund manager who makes $340 million per year compares himself to the top five hedge fund managers, who earned at least $770 million in 2018. Those top managers can look ahead to people like Warren Buffett, whose personal fortune increased by $3.5 billion in 2018.

But the most powerful and important book should be called Shut Up And Wait. It’s just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If I had to summarize money success in a single word it would be “survival.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There are two reasons why a survival mentality is so key with money. One is the obvious: few gains are so great that they’re worth wiping yourself out over. The other, as we saw in chapter 4, is the counterintuitive math of compounding. Compounding only works if you can give an asset years and years to grow. It’s like planting oak trees: A year of growth will never show much progress, 10 years can make a meaningful difference, and 50 years can create something absolutely extraordinary.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone’s reality.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Our standard of living increased 20-fold in these 170 years, but barely a day went by that lacked tangible reasons for pessimism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A mindset that can be paranoid and optimistic at the same time is hard to maintain, because seeing things as black or white takes less effort than accepting nuance. But you need short-term paranoia to keep you alive long enough to exploit long-term optimism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The hardest thing about this was that I loved the work. And I wanted to work hard. But doing something you love on a schedule you can’t control can feel the same as doing something you hate.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"People like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat. When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Someone driving a $100,000 car might be wealthy. But the only data point you have about their wealth is that they have $100,000 less than they did before they bought the car (or $100,000 more in debt). That’s all you know about them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Savings without a spending goal gives you options and flexibility, the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. It gives you time to think. It lets you change course on your own terms. Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Richard Feynman, the great physicist, once said, “Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.” Well, investors have feelings. Quite a few of them. That’s why it’s hard to predict what they’ll do next based solely on what they did in the past.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The most important economic events of the future—things that will move the needle the most—are things that history gives us little to no guide about. They will be unprecedented events. Their unprecedented nature means we won’t be prepared for them, which is part of what makes them so impactful. This is true for both scary events like recessions and wars, and great events like innovation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The further back in history you look, the more general your takeaways should be. General things like people’s relationship to greed and fear, how they behave under stress, and how they respond to incentives tend to be stable in time. The history of money is useful for that kind of stuff. But specific trends, specific trades, specific sectors, specific causal relationships about markets, and what people should do with their money are always an example of evolution in progress. Historians are not prophets.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Graham’s margin of safety is a simple suggestion that we don’t need to view the world in front of us as black or white, predictable or a crapshoot. The grey area—pursuing things where a range of potential outcomes are acceptable—is the smart way to proceed.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Bill Gates understood this well. When Microsoft was a young company, he said he “came up with this incredibly conservative approach that I wanted to have enough money in the bank to pay a year’s worth of payroll even if we didn’t get any payments coming in.” Warren Buffett expressed a similar idea when he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 2008: “I have pledged—to you, the rating agencies and myself—to always run Berkshire with more than ample cash ... When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits.”44\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nassim Taleb says, “You can be risk loving and yet completely averse to ruin.” And indeed, you should. The idea is that you have to take risk to get ahead, but no risk that can wipe you out is ever worth taking. The odds are in your favor when playing Russian roulette. But the downside is not worth the potential upside. There is no margin of safety that can compensate for the risk.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Leverage is the devil here. Leverage—taking on debt to make your money go further—pushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin. The danger is that rational optimism most of the time masks the odds of ruin some of the time. The result is we systematically underestimate risk. Housing prices fell 30% last decade. A few companies defaulted on their debt. That’s capitalism. It happens. But those with high leverage had a double wipeout: Not only were they left broke, but being wiped out erased every opportunity to get back in the game at the very moment opportunity was ripe. A homeowner wiped out in 2009 had no chance of taking advantage of cheap mortgage rates in 2010. Lehman Brothers had no chance of investing in cheap debt in 2009. They were done.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"I think of my own money as barbelled. I take risks with one portion and am terrified with the other.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"You can plan for every risk except the things that are too crazy to cross your mind. And those crazy things can do the most harm, because they happen more often than you think and you have no plan for how to deal with them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A good rule of thumb for a lot of things in life is that everything that can break will eventually break. So if many things rely on one thing working, and that thing breaks, you are counting the days to catastrophe. That’s a single point of failure.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The biggest single point of failure with money is a sole reliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs, with no savings to create a gap between what you think your expenses are and what they might be in the future.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Predicting what you’ll use your savings for assumes you live in a world where you know exactly what your future expenses will be, which no one does. I save a lot, and I have no idea what I’ll use the savings for in the future. Few financial plans that only prepare for known risks have enough margin of safety to survive the real world.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"An underpinning of psychology is that people are poor forecasters of their future selves.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Only 27% of college grads have a job related to their major, according to the Federal Reserve.46 Twenty-nine percent of stay-at-home parents have a college degree.47 Few likely regret their education, of course. But we should acknowledge that a new parent in their 30s may think about life goals in a way their 18-year-old self making career goals would never imagine.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we’re going to become, and then when we become those people, we’re not always thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain. On and on and on.48\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“All of us,” he said, “are walking around with an illusion—an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives.” We tend to never learn this lesson. Gilbert’s research shows people from age 18 to 68 underestimate how much they will change in the future.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. Assuming you’ll be happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds that you’ll one day find yourself at a point of regret. The fuel of the End of History Illusion is that people adapt to most circumstances, so the benefits of an extreme plan—the simplicity of having hardly anything, or the thrill of having almost everything—wear off. But the downsides of those extremes—not being able to afford retirement, or looking back at a life spent devoted to chasing dollars—become enduring regrets. Regrets are especially painful when you abandon a previous plan and feel like you have to run in the other direction twice as fast to make up for lost time.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Responding to critics who said his actions were wrong and what he should have done was obvious, Immelt told his successor, “Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it because the challenges faced by someone in the arena are often invisible to those in the crowd.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The S&P 500 increased 119-fold in the 50 years ending 2018.

The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided. You’re supposed to make decisions that preempt and avoid fines. Traffic fines and IRS fines mean you did something wrong and deserve to be punished. The natural response for anyone who watches their wealth decline and views that drop as a fine is to avoid future fines.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"thinking of market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is an important part of developing the kind of mindset that lets you stick around long enough for investing gains to work in your favor.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It’s hard to grasp that other investors have different goals than we do, because an anchor of psychology is not realizing that rational people can see the world through a different lens than your own. Rising prices persuade all investors in ways the best marketers envy. They are a drug that can turn value-conscious investors into dewy-eyed optimists, detached from their own reality by the actions of someone playing a different game than they are.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A takeaway here is that few things matter more with money than understanding your own time horizon and not being persuaded by the actions and behaviors of people playing different games than you are.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“For reasons I have never understood, people like to hear that the world is going to hell.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Pessimism isn’t just more common than optimism.

Say we’re headed for average growth and no one particularly cares. Say we’re nearing the next Great Depression and you’ll get on TV. But mention that good times are ahead, or markets have room to run, or that a company has huge potential, and a common reaction from commentators and spectators alike is that you are either a salesman or comically aloof of risks.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But a few other things make financial pessimism easy, common, and more persuasive than optimism. One is that money is ubiquitous, so something bad happening tends to affect everyone and captures everyone’s attention.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On January 5th, 1889, the Detroit Free Press pushed back against the long-held dream that man could one day fly like a bird. Airplanes, the paper wrote, “appear impossible”: The smallest possible weight of a flying machine, with the necessary fuel and engineer, could not be less than 300 or 400 pounds … but there is a low limit of weight, certainly not much beyond fifty pounds, beyond which it is impossible for an animal to fly. Nature has reached this limit, and with her utmost effort has failed to pass it. Six months later, Orville Wright dropped out of high school to help his brother, Wilbur, tinker in their backyard shed to build a printing press. It was the brothers’ first joint invention. It would not be their last.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Washington Post wrote in 1909: “There will never be such a thing as commercial aerial freighters. Freight will continue to drag its slow weight across the patient earth.” The first cargo plane took off five months later.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Consider the progress of medicine. Looking at the last year will do you little good. Any single decade won’t do much better. But looking at the last 50 years will show something extraordinary. For example, the age-adjusted death rate per capita from heart disease has declined more than 70% since 1965, according to the National Institute of Health.63 A 70% decline in heart-disease death is enough to save something like half a million American lives per year. Picture the population of Atlanta saved every year. But since that progress happened so slowly, it captures less attention than quick, sudden losses like terrorism, plane crashes, or natural disasters. We could have a Hurricane Katrina five times a week, every week—imagine how much attention that would receive—and it would not offset the number of annual lives saved by the decline in heart disease in the last 50 years.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Less ego, more wealth.

If he finds other life—another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod—there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization. It’s the explanation for the Fermi Paradox.”\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/f97bbfcb-a51e-4713-9ea9-95680b5d34a7.html","relUrl":"notes/f97bbfcb-a51e-4713-9ea9-95680b5d34a7.html"},{"doc":"The Grade Cricketer: Tea and No Sympathy","title":"The Grade Cricketer: Tea and No Sympathy","hpath":"kindle_highlights.tea_and_no_sympathy","content":"\n\"It wasn’t unheard of for Nuggsy to head straight to a game from a night out. Once he actually wore his whites out on a Friday night in order to conserve time the next morning.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Only cricketers could invent meaningless verbiage and lend it primal aggression.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Now most grade cricket clubs provide rolling updates for their Twitter followers throughout the course of a day. There really is a lot of useless shit on the internet.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Mate,’ I started, as always. (Even when addressing their mortal enemy Australian men will employ this term of endearment.) ‘What the fuck are you up to here?’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Two club presidents betting on the outcome of a grade cricket final. Un-fucking-believable. But…was it, really? Actually, it all kind of made sense suddenly. From the outside, club presidents poured thousands of dollars into grade cricket with seemingly no expectation of return, aside from the meaningless power one wields from being the president of a cricket club. But perhaps there was a return, after all? Perhaps grade cricket was completely rigged—nothing more than a plaything for rich white men to fuck with, placing bets and fixing matches unbeknown to the players themselves, save for a few key conduits like Nuggsy, who were able to bridge these murky waters.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"would never normally admit it outwardly, but I had been a pillar of mediocrity for the majority of the year.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"I figured that off spin is literally the easiest skill one can perform in cricket—no different from turning a doorknob clockwise in terms of the effort exuded.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If only those children were old enough to know that Daddy would rather stand at second slip and touch the cricket ball twice in six hours than spend a beautiful Saturday afternoon teaching them to read.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In short, the very moment you think you’re on top, cricket—much like life—has a way of bringing you back down to earth with shattering force.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘When I was your age, I already had fifteen years of full-time work under my belt.’ During conversations like these, I always consoled myself with the fact that my parents’ generation was responsible for the majority of the social and economic problems that exist today. Born in the aftermath of World War II, they were lucky enough to be the beneficiaries of free higher education, affordable house prices and a stable global outlook. It seemed like there were jobs everywhere back then too. By the sounds of it, you could walk into any office and ask, ‘Can I have a job?’, no references required, nothing. That was literally how everyone got work back then. You’d shake some bloke’s hand and, over the course of several decades, eventually work your way up the corporate ladder to become the CEO. Some forty years later you announce your retirement, having racked up enough superannuation to purchase three waterfront properties in Sydney. These days, if you walked into an office and just point-blank asked for a job, you’d be escorted out by security within six seconds on suspicion of being an Islamic State terrorist. As such, we’re all stuck doing three-month unpaid internships on the off-chance we might snare a $35,000 per annum content-writing gig for some shitty youth-skewed online publication.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"my chances of buying property are about as good as me holding onto a catch in the cordon: fucking slim to none.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This was my equivalent of the Gatting Ball in the 1993 Ashes series, and Dad was Warney, lapping up his victory with oafish glee. In my defence, it was the first off cutter I had ever faced in my young life, since, generally speaking, eleven-year-old seam bowlers are yet to develop their wrists and fingers to the extent that they can successfully impart sideways movement. Some of the other fathers suggested I be given a reprieve for getting out first ball, but Dad wasn’t having any of it. In retrospect, it was probably a bit over the top for him to point aggressively towards the pavilion and order me to ‘fuck off, cunt’, but he’d been made redundant earlier that week, so I can’t hold it against him for wanting to blow off a bit of steam.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"remembered the first time I’d seen Nuggsy do this trick, back in my first season as an impressionable nineteen-year-old. I’d immediately consulted YouTube to try to replicate it myself but only ended up getting into a heated argument with an anonymous stranger in the comments section about whether George Bush ‘did’ 9/11.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When it comes to nightclub protocol, most men prefer to play the role of the hungry lion standing on the edge of the watering hole, waiting for an opportunity to pounce. Go to any nightclub and you’ll see an abundance of single men milling around on the side of the dancefloor, one hand in their hip pocket, the other clasping a schooner of domestic lager, tapping one foot to the beat of the music and bobbing their head at a similar pace, craning their necks in an undignified attempt to establish a connection with someone, anyone. Sadly, eighty per cent of these men will go home having not spoken a single word to a woman that evening, bound by their own crippling self-doubt. If only they had the courage to step onto that dancefloor and flail their arms in the air they might actually end up going home with someone, rather than getting into a fight with another bloke outside a kebab shop at 3 a.m. Say what you will about the lockout laws but I personally think the best way to curb alcohol-related violence is to teach blokes how to dance properly.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Thanks for coming over—I thought he was never going to stop talking about his Michelle Pfeiffer in second grade, whatever any of that sentence means.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Of course, if it was revealed to my then teammates that I was in a book club I risked the admonishment of my peers—a collection of individuals who I fucking hated anyway, but whose validation I lived and died by.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘So, I’m thinking you and me should do it together,’ Jai murmured seductively. I realised I needed to interject now, lest Alex fall even deeper into his emerald eyes. ‘Nah, it’s all good, champ,’ I blurted. ‘Excuse me?’ ‘Alex and I are going to work on this one. I think there’s a few people over there still looking for a partner.’ I gesticulated toward the front corner of the lecture hall, where a collection of social outcasts stood. ‘Is that right?’ Jai replied, his eyes still transfixed upon Alex. It was like he was putting her under a spell. Jai’s answer sent me into full ‘catcher behind the wicket’ mode. Without explanation, I unleashed a series of cricket sledges that would normally be directed at opposition batsmen but were now being applied out of context and targeted at a defiantly anti-sport hipster. ‘Come on here, lads! This bloke’s got no idea! Someone get this bloke a gym membership! One brings two!’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"I stifled a snigger at the thought that grade cricket was my mistress and waiting to have sex with me again. Like an incessant ex-girlfriend you know is no good for you, but you keep going back to her anyway. Why? Well, because it’s all you’ve ever known and you have a deep-seated fear of change.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Goes without saying that I didn’t really give a shit what some bloke in twos was doing for a crust. He could have raised forty thousand dollars for breast cancer research by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro for all I knew, but if he was consistently pushing them down the leg side, he was dead to me.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It was more socially acceptable for two women to go for a coffee and talk for hours, gazing into each other’s eyes, gleaning all the ins and outs of the human experience. For men, we always had to be ‘doing’ something, even if that meant sitting next to each other and getting drunk in a bar, watching some form of televised sport. Again, even if a meaningful conversation between two men did take place in this environment, the excessive consumption of alcohol would have created large blackspots in the participants’ memory, rendering all the content forgotten within the space of twelve hours.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It goes without saying that both teams cannot have the same amount of energy at the same time, for there is a finite amount of energy on a cricket field.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"always, this placed me in a difficult predicament. When you come to the wicket at, say, 4-20, after a flurry of wickets, you’ve got very little to lose. People’s expectations are low. You can play it one of two ways: grit it out and soak up as many balls as possible, so that you can return to the pavilion and receive plaudits for your defiant innings in the face of adversity, or give yourself a licence to tee off and earn some quick runs. The second scenario is a win-win, in the sense that if you get out you can blame the batsmen before you for failing to lay a platform. It’s their fault, not yours. And if, by some stroke of fortune, you do manage to pile on 30 or 40 runs, well, you’re a hero.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Whether it’s the sly ‘what can I get you, champ’ from a barista, or a ‘did you tap on there, pal’ from an eagled-eyed bus driver, life in itself is a constant alpha showdown. These days I can barely communicate with another human being—male or female—without wondering whether I’m being belittled in some form or another.\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/kBLoPAnOKOwEg22JwO7Pe.html","relUrl":"notes/kBLoPAnOKOwEg22JwO7Pe.html"},{"doc":"Project Hail Mary","title":"Project Hail Mary","hpath":"kindle_highlights.project_hail_mary","content":"","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/y233v4c83QZcCmiARLNiV.html","relUrl":"notes/y233v4c83QZcCmiARLNiV.html"},{"doc":"Nehru: The Invention of India","title":"Nehru: The Invention of India","hpath":"kindle_highlights.nehru_the_invention_of_india","content":"\n\"Jawaharlal expressed admiration for the nationalism of Tilak and the Extremists, criticizing his father for being ‘immoderately moderate’. Years later he recognized that his father’s objections to the Extremists were based less on a dislike of their methods than on the Hindu nationalism they expressed, at odds with Motilal’s own secular cosmopolitanism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘My general attitude to life at the time,’ he later wrote, ‘was a vague kind of Cyrenaicism . . . . It is easy and gratifying to give a long Greek name to the desire for a soft life and pleasant experiences.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If the father set the ultimate bar very high, he also urged his son to seek smaller successes, from becoming Senior Wrangler at school to taking the Indian Civil Service (ICS) examinations (which Jawaharlal in fact never did).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘education does not consist of passing examinations or knowing English or mathematics. It is a mental state.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Sixteen hundred bullets were fired that day into the unarmed throng, and when the job was finished, just ten minutes later, 379 people lay dead and 1,137 lay injured, many grotesquely maimed for life. A total of 1,516 casualties from 1,600 bullets: only 84 had failed to find their mark, a measure of how simple, and how brutal, Dyer’s task was.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the English reaction to the Massacre—Dyer was publicly feted, and a collection raised for him amongst English expatriates in India brought him the quite stupendous sum of a quarter of a million pounds—was almost as bad as the massacre itself.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Senseless and criminal bigotry,’ he wrote in a speech delivered for him when he was ill in October 1923, ‘struts about in the name of religion and instils hatred and violence into the people.’ Three years later he wrote to a Muslim friend that ‘what is required in India most is a course of study of Bertrand Russell’s books.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"religion, Nehru wrote, was a ‘terrible burden’ that India had to get rid of if it was to ‘breathe freely or do anything useful’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"(His admiration for China was deeply rooted in a sense of civilizational commonality, and would last through the Communist Revolution, foundering finally on the Himalayan wastes captured by the People’s Liberation Army in their war with India in 1962.)\"\n\n---------\n\n\"No sooner had the Congress session begun than Jawaharlal was embroiled in a controversy over a draft resolution he submitted calling, in explicit detail, for complete independence for India. The party leaders, including Gandhi himself, thought this was going too far; freedom within the Empire, or Dominion Status, was the most they felt they could stake a claim for, and it was already more than the British had shown any inclination to grant.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Jawaharlal had been ‘half-blinded with the blows’ but had had enough presence of mind to refuse the offer of two revolvers from a police agent seeking to entrap him in the midst of the melée. The grace under pressure he revealed on that occasion was also reflected in a telegram he sent anxious friends in London: ‘Thanks. Injuries severe but not serious. Hope [to] survive the British Empire.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Indian and foreign Communists saw him as one who uttered Communist slogans but took no steps to achieve them; his rhetoric, they argued, aimed not at revolution but at ‘getting support from the proletariat’ for his nationalist goals.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, fifteen years older than Jawaharlal and a doughty organizer who was already being thought of as the ‘Iron Man’ of the Congress, had more support than Nehru for the top job. But though the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) was not enthusiastic about Gandhi’s announcement that Jawaharlal would lead it, the party could not repudiate the Mahatma.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘What shall it profit you to get your empty degrees and your mess of pottage if the millions starve and your motherland continues in bondage? Who lives if India dies? Who dies if India lives?’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Motilal’s last words on earth were to Mahatma Gandhi, in praise of the Garhwalis, the Hindu troops who had refused to fire on the Muslim Khudai Khidmatgar protestors in Peshawar the previous year.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Almost every Englishman, however advanced he may be politically, is a bit of an imperialist in matters relating to India.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘We cannot afford to get excited in politics,’ Jawaharlal advised a young party worker in 1931. ‘We must preserve our balance and not rush into any action without proper consideration . . . . [We must not] lose the benefit of collective action and of [a united] organization.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In concluding the Gandhi-Irwin Pact the Viceroy disregarded one of the Mahatma’s pleas, that the lives of the young revolutionary, Bhagat Singh, and his companions, who had been arrested for throwing bombs into the Legislative Assembly, be spared.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Mahatma derived his ethic from God; the author of Glimpses of World History derived his from Man, or at least from his study of mankind. He found Gandhi’s ‘frequent references to God . . . most irritating.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He joined her at a clinic in Badenweiler in Nazi Germany (where he made it a point to make his purchases from Jewish shopkeepers), then moved her to Lausanne, but it was all in vain.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On his way back by air from Switzerland with Kamala’s ashes he was obliged to transit through the airport in Rome. Mussolini, Italy’s Fascist dictator, sent a message of condolences and asked to meet with the Indian nationalist hero. A man of lesser principle might have seen this as an opportunity to win some international prominence for himself and his cause, but Jawaharlal, whose abhorrence of Fascism was, if anything, even greater than his distaste of imperialism, firmly refused the invitation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Birla, at whose home Mahatma Gandhi could often be found, discreetly offered Jawaharlal a monthly stipend to free his mind of financial worries. Jawaharlal turned it down, furious that any capitalist could presume to place him on his payroll.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Within a year of the election this unusual democrat pseudonymously authored a remarkable attack upon himself in the Modern Review: [Nehru] has all the makings of a dictator in him—vast popularity, a strong will directed to a well-defined purpose, energy, pride, organizational capacity, ability, hardness, and, with all his love of the crowd, an intolerance of others and a certain contempt of the weak and the inefficient . . . . From the far north to Cape Comorin he has gone like some triumphant Caesar, leaving a trail of glory and legend behind him . . . . [I]s it his will to power that is driving him from crowd to crowd? His conceit is already formidable. He must be checked. We want no Caesars.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"nationalism above socialism. His first campaign speech in Bombay, an assault on capitalism, won him cheers from the sansculottes and such opprobrium from businessmen that the British thought his leadership would divide the party irrevocably and lead it to electoral disaster. Once again, they were proved wrong; but this was at least partly because Jawaharlal chose not to go so far as to damage the party.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nehru bridled at what he saw as Jinnah’s pretensions, challenging the representativeness of the League’s leadership: ‘I come into greater touch with the Muslim masses,’ he declared acidly, ‘than most of the members of the Muslim League.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"he rejected the notion that the League (a ‘drawing-room party’) had any valid place: ‘There are only two forces in the country, the Congress and the Government. Those who are standing midway shall have to choose between the two.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The lead Congress negotiator was a Muslim, Maulana Azad; the lead League negotiator was Chaudhury Khaliquzzaman, formerly a close friend of Jawaharlal’s who had often enjoyed his hospitality, staying at Anand Bhavan whenever he visited Allahabad. The two negotiators came close to an agreement. The League was even willing to merge its identity in the provincial legislature with that of the Congress, but the deal finally foundered on the League’s insistence that its legislators would be free to vote differently on ‘communal issues’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In a passionate letter to his old friend, Khaliquzzaman, he asked: ‘Why should I accept it [the League] as the representatives of the Muslims of India when I know it represents [only] the handful of Muslims at the top who deliberately seek refuge in the name of religion to avoid discussing mass problems?’ The Congress of Jawaharlal Nehru was committed to land reform; the League was in thrall to big Muslim landowners.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even some of Gandhiji’s phrases sometimes jarred upon me—thus his frequent reference to Ram Raj as a golden age which was to return.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In July 1937 Jinnah issued a statement deploring the Congress’ ‘mass contact’ policy with Muslims: ‘There is plenty of scope for Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to improve his own people, the Hindus,’ he declared. Nehru replied immediately: ‘Not being religiously or communally inclined, I venture to think of my people as the Indian people as a whole.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He organized demonstrations against Mussolini, a boycott of Japanese goods (over that country’s conduct in China), a China relief fund and a medical unit to serve there. When his mother passed away, after a long illness, in January 1938, and since his daughter, Indira was studying at Oxford, Jawaharlal decided to travel to Europe. This time there were no Government-imposed restrictions on his activities, and he pursued an openly political agenda, meeting with Egyptian nationalists at Alexandria before travelling overland to Spain as a guest of the Republican government. He spent five days in Barcelona, braving Franco’s air-raids, and felt strongly tempted to join the International Brigades battling Fascism there.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"met the new Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, who had succeeded Willingdon in 1936 and was then on holiday in Britain. At this meeting he declared to the nonplussed Viceroy that he ‘gave England at the outside ten years before India [became] independent.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"His view was that India should stay out of any such conflict until she had obtained her freedom from the imperialists who would seek to exploit her. But his abhorrence of Fascism was so great that he would gladly lead a free India into war on the side of the democracies, provided that choice was made by Indians and not imposed upon them by the British.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Jawaharlal Nehru was in China when war broke out. He was enormously attracted to the idea of India enjoying close relations with that other great ancient Asian civilization, and he entertained romantic notions of a grand eastern alliance between the two as they each emerged from the incubus of colonialism and rose to the challenge of developing their fractured societies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"How could a subject India be ordered to fight for a free Poland? A free and democratic India, on the other hand, would gladly fight for freedom and democracy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nehru made no secret of his own anti-Nazi views; his dislike of Fascism ran so deep that he dismissed a sub-editor at the National Herald who, in an excess of patriotism, had published a pro-German headline. All he wanted was some indication from the British Government of respect for his position so that India and Britain could then gladly ‘join in a struggle for freedom.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Viceroy’s statement in October 1939 emphatically rejecting the Congress position, however, prompted the Working Committee, with Jawaharlal in the lead, to order all its provincial ministries to resign rather than continue to serve a war effort in which they had been denied an honourable role. The decision was taken on a point of principle, but politically it proved a monumental blunder. It deprived the Congress of their only leverage with the British Government, cast aside the fruits of their electoral success, and presented Jinnah with a golden opportunity. He broke off talks with the Congress—declaring the day of the Congress resignations a ‘day of deliverance’—and turned to the Viceroy instead.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On 7 August 1942 in Bombay, the All-India Congress Committee, at the Mahatma’s urging, adopted a resolution moved by Nehru, and seconded by Patel, calling upon Britain to—in a journalistic paraphrase that became more famous than the actual words of the resolution—’Quit India’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Muslims of India, he wrote, ‘are only technically a minority. They are vast in numbers and powerful in other ways, and it is patent that they cannot be coerced against their will . . . . This communal question is essentially one of protection of vested interests, and religion has always been a useful stalking horse for this purpose.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nehru, still imagining an all-powerful adversary seeking to perpetuate its hegemony, and unaware of the extent to which the League had become a popular party amongst Indian Muslims, dealt with both on erroneous premises. ‘How differently would Nehru and his colleagues have negotiated,’ Talbot wondered, ‘had they understood Britain’s weakness rather than continuing to be obsessed with its presumed strength?’ The question haunts our hindsight.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kashmir, a Muslim-majority area nominally outside the British Raj, whose autocratic and sybaritic Hindu Maharajah Jawaharlal despised, and whose indigenous opposition, the non-communal National Conference, was led by a friend and supporter, the Muslim socialist, Sheikh Abdullah.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The nationalist movement’s politics of protest had made Jawaharlal a master of the futile gesture—precisely the kind of politics that had led to the resignations of the Congress ministries in 1939 and the Quit India movement in 1942, and thus paved the way for the triumph of the Muslim League.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"as riots broke out in Bihar in early November (with the Mahatma walking through the strife-torn province, single-handedly restoring calm), Jinnah declared on 14 November that the killing would not stop unless Pakistan was created.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is no question that Jawaharlal and Edwina indeed became close, and some circumstantial evidence that they may well have become closer at a later stage in their lives, but it does not seem likely that this occurred early enough to have any political impact (or indeed that, if it did, it would have had any such impact). Nehru was certainly no celibate; particularly after the death of Kamala when he was only forty-seven, he enjoyed close relations with a number of women friends, though he never contemplated marriage again. Nehru’s biographer Frank Moraes wrote that Edwina ‘sensed that what Nehru most wanted and did not know how to achieve was to relax.’ This she was able to get him to do, at a time of great tension. But while he enjoyed Edwina’s company, he had far more on his mind in 1947 than a dalliance with the Viceroy’s spouse.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What Jawaharlal had thought of as a temporary secession of certain parts of India hardened into the creation of two separate and hostile states that would fight three wars with each other over the next twenty-four years.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even before the police arrived in force, Jawaharlal Nehru was on the scene . . ., trying to bring people to their senses. He spied a Moslem who had just been seized by Hindus. He interposed himself between the man and his attackers. Suddenly a cry went up: ‘Jawaharlal is here!’ . . . . It had a magical effect. People stood still . . . . Looted merchandise was dropped. The mob psychology disintegrated. By the time the police arrived people were dispersing. The riot was over . . . . The fact that Nehru had risked his life to save a single Moslem had a profound effect far beyond New Delhi. Many thousands of Moslems who had intended to flee to Pakistan now stayed in India, staking their lives on Nehru’s ability to protect them and assure them justice.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By August 1953 Jawaharlal’s Kashmir policy was in a shambles. His friend and ally, Sheikh Abdullah had begun flirting with notions of independence, and Nehru made the painful decision to place him under arrest.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One of Prasad’s first acts upon election was to ask that 26 January be changed to a date deemed more auspicious by his astrologers. Jawaharlal flatly turned him down, declaring that India would not be run by astrologers if he had anything to do with it. This time, Nehru won.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When President Prasad sought directly to send Parliament his objections to the Hindu Code Bill (an attempt to reform Hindu personal law that Jawaharlal was strongly promoting), Nehru told him this would be an unconstitutional interference in the work of his government and threatened to resign over the issue. Prasad backed off.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In his own constituency, Phulpur, Jawaharlal faced a Hindu sadhu who tried to exploit his co-religionists’s disillusionment with Nehru’s ‘appeasement’ of Muslims. Nehru won by 233,571 votes to 56,718.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nehru prompted the Government of India to adopt an Industrial Policy Resolution in April 1948 that granted the state monopolies over railways, atomic energy and defence manufacturing as well as reserved rights relating to any new enterprise in a host of vital areas, from coal and steel to shipbuilding and communications.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nehru placed bureaucrats rather than entrepreneurs upon the commanding heights, stifled initiative and investment, and spent the rest of his years in office presiding over a system that sought to regulate stagnation and divide poverty.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All too often, opposition to planning was made to seem like opposition to a fundamental national interest and disloyalty to Jawaharlal himself. Under Nehru, socialism (as he practised it) became a national dogma, to which his successors stayed loyal long after other developing countries, realizing the folly of his ways, had adopted a different path.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Every conceivable argument has been available to tempt Mr Nehru to forego democratic institutions in India,’ Bertrand Russell wrote. ‘Illiteracy and poverty, disease and ignorance, a great subcontinent to govern, severe differences between Muslim and Hindu, many scores of languages and varied cultures reflecting a tendency toward a breaking up of the Union . . . .’ Nehru rejected all these arguments.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Indian diplomats who have seen the files swear that at about the same time Jawaharlal also declined a US offer to take the permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council then held, with scant credibility, by Taiwan, urging that it be offered to Beijing instead. Nehru took pride in his principled approach to world politics. But it was one thing to fulminate against Great Power machinations, another to run a national foreign policy with little regard to the imperatives of power or the need for a country to bargain from a position of strength.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Worse, she was indiscreet enough to express her personal anti-communism to American and British diplomats without first checking for bugs, and the Russians, unamused, did not find it worthwhile to grant her an audience with Stalin.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nehru, ever the democrat, confronted the issue of succession directly in a 1961 interview: ‘I am not trying to start a dynasty. I am not capable of ruling from the grave. How terrible it would be if I, after all I have said about the processes of democratic government, were to attempt to handpick a successor. The best I can do for India is to help our people as a whole to generate new leadership as it may be needed.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The domineering Motilal adored and spoiled his son, but may well have instilled in him a tragic flaw for a leader—an instinctive sense that the ultimate responsibility for decision lay elsewhere than in himself. Knowing that his father, and later the Mahatma, were there encouraged in Jawaharlal a tendency to temporize and vacillate, to indulge in reflection and thinking aloud, and yet not commit to a concrete decision.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The stench of corruption reached Jawaharlal’s own circles three times in the later years of his rule: when his Finance Minister, T. T. Krishnamachari, was obliged to resign in 1958 over improprieties in a life insurance scandal (it was Feroze Gandhi’s muckraking that brought about Krishnamachari’s downfall); when his friend, Jayanti Dharma Teja, whom Nehru had helped set up a major shipping line, defaulted on loans and skipped the country; and when Jawaharlal’s own private secretary since 1946, M.O. Mathai, who was accused both of spying for the CIA and of accumulating an ill-gotten fortune, was forced to resign in 1959. In none of these cases was there the slightest suggestion that Jawaharlal had profited personally in any way from the actions of his associates, but they again confirmed that Nehru’s loyalty exceeded his judgement. (And in dozens of other cases where corruption was not an issue, he picked unsuitable aides and persisted in his support for them well after their ineptitude had been revealed.) By the late 1950s he was widely considered a poor judge of men, and not merely by his critics.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The occasion saw the passage of various resolutions condemning war and calling for nuclear disarmament, of which Nehru was inordinately proud. It was a telling indication of the gulf between his view of the world and the international realities with which he had to deal.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When the shooting started with a series of border incidents later that year, India was found woefully unprepared. Yet Nehru refused to believe China would ever embark on war with India, and did unconscionably little to prepare his forces for one. His Defence Minister from 1957 on was the leftist ideologue Krishna Menon, a votary of self-reliance who refused to import defence equipment and turned the military factories into production lines for hairpins and pressure-cookers. In 1959 Menon clashed publicly with the Army chief, General Thimayya, who had to be persuaded by Nehru to withdraw his resignation after being denounced as pro-West by his own minister.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As late as August 1961 Jawaharlal told Parliament that India did not believe in war, and would not act ‘in a huff’ but behave with ‘wisdom and strength’, complacent banalities that revealed neither wisdom nor strength.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On 8 September 1962 the Chinese crossed the McMahon Line, claiming self-defence against Indian ‘aggression’, then stopped. Nehru and Menon persuaded themselves that the incident was only a skirmish, and each travelled on planned visits abroad. But neither seemed to have realized the extent of the Chinese mobilization. On 20 October, waves of Chinese troops poured across the border. Full-fledged war had broken out.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Three months later, in November 1963, Jawaharlal launched India’s own space programme, a moment immortalized in a photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson showing a rocket-part being carried on the back of a bicycle. Six years earlier Jawaharlal had inaugurated India’s first atomic research reactor. Nuclear power and space technology: there was no limit to his scientific aspirations for India, and yet the country was moored in the bicycle age at least partly because of his unwillingness to open it up to the world.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Years earlier Jawaharlal had repeated a question posed to him by an American interviewer: ‘My legacy to India? Hopefully, it is 400 million people capable of governing themselves.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nehru’s impact on India rested on four major pillars—democratic institution-building, staunch pan-Indian secularism, socialist economics at home and a foreign policy of non-alignment. All four remain as official tenets of Indian governance, but all have been challenged, and strained to the breaking point, by the developments of recent years.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"there is no denying the disillusionment with aspects of Indian democracy that afflicts middle-class India; many who ought to know better lapse disturbingly into a wistful longing for benign authoritarianism. Jawaharlal’s daughter Indira suspended the country’s democratic freedoms during a twenty-two-month ‘State of Emergency’ from 1975-77, imprisoning her opponents, suspending civil rights, censoring the press. It is a measure of the values she imbibed at her father’s knee that she then held a free and fair election and lost it comprehensively.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘The [real] danger to India,’ Nehru declared bluntly the year before his death, ‘is Hindu right-wing communalism.’ Nehru himself was an avowed agnostic, as was his daughter until she discovered the electoral advantages of public piety.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If Muslim politicians developed a vested interest in minorityhood, the Nehruvian state evolved a vested interest in its perpetuation: support the leaders of the minority, pre-empt their radicalization by giving them no cause to fear the state, and so co-opt them into the national consensus. When objections to national policy were voiced on religious grounds, as over the Shah Bano case in 1986, when a Supreme Court ruling granted a Muslim woman alimony in defiance of Muslim personal law, the state (under Nehru’s grandson, Rajiv Gandhi) rushed to appease the most conservative elements in the minority community. This was not particularly secular in any sense of the term, let alone Jawaharlal Nehru’s, but secularism is what Indians have called it for over five decades.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Independent India’s determination to compensate for millennia of injustice to its social underclasses meant that, from the very first, the ‘Scheduled Castes and Tribes’ (so called because the eligible groups of Dalits and aboriginals were listed in a Schedule annexed to the Constitution) were granted guaranteed quotas in schools and colleges, in government jobs, both in officialdom and in the public sector industries, and uniquely, in Parliament. Indeed, so complete was the country’s acceptance of the principle of affirmative action that the clamour to join the bandwagon of reservations grew, and led to more and more groups wanting reservations of their own. The addition of the ‘backward classes’ as recommended by the Mandal Commission has now taken the total of reserved jobs in the federal government and national governmental institutions to 49.5 per cent, and in several states the local reservations are even higher, extending to some 69 per cent in Tamil Nadu state.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘In my grandparents’ time, caste governed their lives: they ate, socialized, married, lived, according to caste rules. In my parents’ time, during the nationalist movement, they were encouraged by Gandhi and Nehru to reject caste; we dropped our caste-derived surnames and declared caste a social evil. As a result, when I grew up, I was unaware of caste; it was an irrelevance at school, at work, in my social contacts; the last thing I thought about was the caste of someone I met. Now, in my children’s generation, the wheel has come full circle. Caste is all-important again. Your caste determines your opportunities, your prospects, your promotions. You can’t go forward unless you’re a Backward.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"most of Nehru’s public sector companies made losses, draining away the Indian taxpayers’ money. Several of the state-owned companies even today are kept running merely to provide jobs—o r, less positively, to prevent the ‘social costs’ (job losses, poverty, political fallout) that would result from closing them down. All this we owe to Nehru.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since economic self-sufficiency was seen by the Nehruvians as the only possible guarantee of political independence, extreme protectionism was imposed: high tariff barriers (import duties of 350 per cent were not uncommon, and the top rate as recently as 1991 was 300 per cent), severe restrictions on the entry of foreign goods, capital and technology, and great pride in the manufacture within India of goods that were obsolete,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is sadly impossible to quantify the economic losses inflicted on India over decades of entrepreneurs frittering away their energies in queuing for licences rather than manufacturing products, paying bribes instead of hiring workers, wooing politicians instead of understanding consumers, ‘getting things done’ through bureaucrats rather than doing things for themselves. This, too, is Nehru’s legacy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The public sector, however, grew in size though not in production, to become the largest in the world outside the Communist bloc.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"India’s curse, Jagdish Bhagwati once observed, was to be afflicted by brilliant economists. Nehru had a weakness for such men: people like P.C. Mahalanobis, who combined intellectual brilliance and ideological wrong-headedness in equal measure, but who was given his head by Jawaharlal to drive India’s economy into a quicksand of regulatory red tape surrounding a mirage of Planning.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When he took over as Minister of External Affairs in India’s first non-Congress government in 1977, Vajpayee noticed that a portrait of Nehru was missing from its usual spot in the ministerial chamber, removed in an excess of zeal by functionaries anxious to please the new rulers. The lifelong critic of the Congress demanded its return.\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/d823632b-6c0e-4e59-a4ed-30dbd6fbb029.html","relUrl":"notes/d823632b-6c0e-4e59-a4ed-30dbd6fbb029.html"},{"doc":"India After Gandhi","title":"India After Gandhi","hpath":"kindle_highlights.india_after_gandhi","content":"\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/356824.India_After_Gandhi\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/wumdyylPfnLYfu0HEkd0m.html","relUrl":"notes/wumdyylPfnLYfu0HEkd0m.html"},{"doc":"In Service of The Republic: The Art and Science of Economic Policy","title":"In Service of The Republic: The Art and Science of Economic Policy","hpath":"kindle_highlights.in_service_of_the_republic","content":"\n\"Market failures come in four kinds: Externalities, Asymmetric information, Market power and Public goods.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"No private firm would produce public goods such as clean air as residents cannot be billed for the services rendered. It is not possible to exclude any person from the benefits. Excludability is essential for firms to obtain a revenue stream. Hence, we require state action to obtain tax revenues and provide the public good.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When faced with a proposed state intervention, our first question should be: What is the market failure that this seeks to address?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"from 1993 onward, in the US, federal officials were required to formally demonstrate the presence of market failure before planning interventions in the economy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"we see three pillars of intervention: production (e.g., government running schools), regulating (e.g., government regulating private schools) and financing (e.g., government paying kids to attend private schools). These flow from the limited toolkit of intervention.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One day, Chairman Mao organized millions of people to kill all the sparrows in China, on the grounds that sparrows eat grain.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"With the sparrows removed from the scene, the insect population surged, and the insects ate the grain. Chairman Mao may have had good intentions, and he may have had practical experience of sparrows eating grain, but the intellectual foundation of the intervention was faulty.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The expenditure per student in government schools rose from Rs 2455 in 2010 to Rs 4385 in 2016. Learning outcomes declined in this period. In 2010, 50.7 per cent of children in class 5 in government schools could read a class 2 level text, but this declined to 42.2 per cent in 2014. Parents voted with their feet, and switched from free government schools to private schools charging a fee. Enrolment in government schools fell by 11.1 million while it rose by 16 million in private schools, from 2010 to 2016. 5\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is black humour in the phrase ‘the law of unintended consequences’. A government intervention that is intended to have a certain outcome will very often end up yielding a very different result. Such failures happen so often that these have been elevated to the level of a humorous ‘law’. It requires extreme clarity of thought to devise policy initiatives that hit the target; all too often the actual outcomes stray far from what was desired.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We need to change course, from viewing government as a benign paternalistic agent that means well, to a more sceptical view of government. We need the state in order to address market failure, and we must give the state the monopoly of violence; but we have to be sceptical about the things that will be done by the state.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Indian state works poorly, experiences panic when faced with a crisis, comes out with an announcement of a policy package that seeks to address the crisis in a short-term way, and retreats back into neglect. Smooth, capable working on an everyday basis has not come about.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is a vast unfinished agenda, in India, of market failures where not enough work has been done. The justice system should be the first priority of civilization. This requires far-reaching work in rethinking laws, police, prisons, public prosecutors and courts. We have major new dimensions of health crises emanating from air quality, road safety, antibiotic resistance and substandard medicines. All these areas require subtle understanding of market failures, and commensurate state interventions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Numerous elements of state coercion present in India lack justification, insofar as there is no market failure that can justify the use of state power. Why does the state control the time at which a stock exchange opens and closes, or the objects that it trades in? Why does the state seek to imprison a farmer if her produce is not sold at a physical market specified by the state? Why does the state plan to put young people into jail if they trade in crypto-currencies? Why is the state forcing corporations to spend 2 per cent of their profit on good works?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What you measure is what you can manage.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Taxation imposes a cost upon society owing to these distortions. The total cost of public expenditure is not just the Re 1 that is directly spent, but also the distortions or lost GDP associated with raising Re 1 of tax revenues. These issues lead up to a critical concept in public finance: the marginal cost of public funds (MCPF). The MCPF tells us the cost to society of Re 1 of public spending. This is typically much larger than Re 1.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"India relies heavily on the corporate tax, and has double taxation of the corporate form. In the last decade, corporate income tax and the dividend distribution tax added up to 35 per cent of total tax collection.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Similarly, 80 per cent of the countries which introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) after 1995 have opted for a single rate GST. In India, various pressure groups lobby for higher or lower taxes on one industry or another, and this distorts the resource allocation of the economy. This drives up the MCPF.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All these factors induce high inefficiencies upon the economy when the government chooses to spend Re 1. There is remarkably little work on measuring the MCPF in India. We believe that the value for India may be about 2.5 to 3.5. As a thumb rule, it is useful to reckon that the cost to society for every rupee of public spending is around Rs 3. The notion of Marginal Cost of Public Funds brings a whole new perspective upon revenues and expenses of government. It encourages us to be very frugal in spending. We should only spend Re 1 when we are sure that the gains to society exceed Rs 3.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the best advanced economies, the numerical value for the MCPF is from 1.5 to 2.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Public administration, the management of government organizations, is harder than management in the private sector, for three reasons. The government wields coercive power (to compel private persons) or the power to spend public money (that is, in turn, obtained by coercing private persons to pay taxes). This is not found in private firms. Private firms keep score using profits or share prices. There is no comparable dashboard in government. Private firms have competitors, and face the threat of going out of business, while the government is a monopolist that will never go out of business.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When the State trespasses beyond what is legitimately within its province, it just hands over the management from those who are interested in frugal and efficient management to bureaucracy which is untrained and uninterested except in its own survival.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Without the toolkit of public choice theory, we tend to think that the solution to one failed bureaucracy is to set up another bureaucracy. We are willing to believe that the Lok Pal will be better than the CBI. We are willing to think that a new independent agency which reviews official statistics will be better than the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Public choice theory encourages us to think that all officials and all politicians are cut from the same cloth. We have to construct systems of checks and balances, that will work through rational incentives of all parties, and without assumptions that any one person is a saint.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Politicians and officials are not benevolent; they are self-interested actors. What appears to be an entrenched mindset, or an entrenched organizational culture, is always endogenous to incentives. A government organization that is riven with corruption is not one which was unlucky to get a lot of corrupt people. It is one where the rules of the game facilitate corruption.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The puzzle of policy design is that of finding the checks and balances, and the rules of the game, through which politicians and officials will generate good outcomes for society when they pursue their own self interest.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the 1860s, the US Congress paid railroad builders per kilometre of rail. This gave incentives to builders to take the longest route between two points. 5\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Later, universities brought high-powered incentives into the management of researchers. Universities demanded publication orientation from researchers. This was done by counting publications in general, and particularly valuing publications in ‘high-prestige journals’. Once researchers were given career gains in return for publications, there was a strong incentive to increase the number of publications, even if this reduced the quality of research. In the extreme, ‘predatory journals’ have sprung up which exchange money for publications.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Policymakers of a socialist vintage feel they should have a large number of levers of control through which prices can be controlled. Modern thinking in public economics guides us into focusing on the appropriate role for policy: addressing market failures. The state is not here to control prices based on rival political influences; the state is here to address market failures.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By this logic, the presence of one large zombie airline harms the viability of all private airlines. When Air India is privatized, and the flow of public money into Air India is halted, all private airlines will benefit, as the prices charged by Air India for tickets are likely to go up.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When a government faces a soft budget constraint, there is a greater temptation to support zombie firms to walk the earth for a few years more. This is one reason why public sector companies are a problem for the economy: there is a greater risk of them becoming zombie firms backed by the exchequer.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The willingness of entrepreneurs to start a business requires an economic environment of limited liability, where the entrepreneur will be able to give up, put the firm into the bankruptcy process, and walk out of it with nothing more than a bruised ego, reputational damage, and valuable experience. A society that pillories entrepreneurs, and turns business failure into protracted disputes or entanglement in agencies, is one which will have less entrepreneurship.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the powers of banking regulation have been utilized to block competition against incumbent banks (e.g., by preventing foreign banks from operating in India, and by preventing the entry of new Indian private banks) and competition against banking (e.g., by preventing adjacent industries from competing against banks for their business). In Indian banking, market power has been induced by RBI. Similarly, the market for agricultural products has been organized around monopoly power for agricultural produce market committees (APMCs). The state has promised to punish farmers if they sell to anyone other than the APMC. In Indian agriculture, market power has been induced by the APMC Acts.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"At the same time, we should recognize that no country got out of poverty through redistribution. All countries which managed to escape from mass deprivation did so through sustained GDP growth that played out over many decades. We should never lose sight of this prioritization of growth-oriented policies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Before Ronald Coase, economists viewed negative externalities as a story with a perpetrator and a victim. It is easy to slip into the assumption that the fishermen are the ones who have to be protected. However, the Coasean analysis yields an important result. Whether the fishermen have property rights, which limit the steel mill’s ability to pollute, or the steel mill has property rights, which limit the other side’s ability to fish, is not important. As long as property rights are clear, both sides will be brought to the table to negotiate. Coase showed us that both parties have a shared interest in finding the right solution, and minimizing total harm. The answer lies in their negotiation, and when this is feasible, we do not require state coercion.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Consider a windmill company which places noise-making wind turbines near a residential community. The command-and-control approach is to view the noise as a negative externality. We would build a government mechanism which caps the noise that windmills can make. We would set up a bureaucratic procedure to identify violations and punish them. The Coasean approach consists of bringing the residents and the company into a negotiation. The company should pay something to the residents in return for the discomfort.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Every legal instrument should state its objective at the outset. After three years have elapsed, an empirical examination of whether these objectives were met should be mandatory. In some situations, there is a role for ‘sunset clauses’ where laws are automatically repealed after a certain time period elapses.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the demonetization episode, such practices would have been quite useful. It would have helped to clearly state the objective up front. It would have helped, to undertake calculations about the costs being imposed upon society. It would have helped, to ask whether there were less intrusive interventions through which the same objectives could be achieved.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In order to do better, and obtain the institutionalized application of mind, these practices need to be codified. Parliamentary law must encode requirements for cost–benefit analysis and ex post review of laws and regulations.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As a thumb rule, each doubling of GDP (in real terms) calls for a fairly far-reaching change in the organization structure of government. It calls for a substantial rethinking of the boundaries and functions of departments and agencies, and of government processes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in the US, the federal Administrative Procedures Act (APA), 1946, prescribes such a machinery that must be used by all federal agencies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 2017, SEBI decided to force these to be shifted from cash settlement to physical settlement. This is a major action, which has a substantial impact upon the life of market participants. The decision was taken without identifying a market failure, measurement or experimentation. There was no ex post review, so we do not know the magnitude of the adverse impact of this decision upon market quality.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It would perhaps have made sense for the government to start by experimenting with these bans in small towns, and simultaneously establish a data-gathering and research process to measure the impacts. Perhaps the scaling up could be from a few towns to a district to a group of districts. At each step, evidence is required before making the next move. The packaging industry would also have time to develop and scale up plastic-free alternatives.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Do things that you can undo.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"do public policy in India, we need to think like an engineer (what are all the moving parts, and the incentives that hold them together) and not a driver (a practitioner who operates in a given institutional apparatus).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Every reform hurts certain firms and certain persons. With more advance warning, they can plan their life better. This would reduce the costs for the economy as a whole.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Healthy democracies are those where various interest groups are able to sit together, engage in discourse in good faith, and emerge with reasonable compromises. The essential foundation for the democratic process of negotiation is trust—a certain presumption of good faith.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The trust building that is required for this is hampered when policy measures are hatched in secrecy and suddenly unveiled upon the populace.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Reaching out to critics is tactically costly as this increases the say that critics have in stalling or subverting a reform. The authoritarian impulse, to favour action over talk, is fashionable. However, the best policy work gets done in the open. The participatory policy process, grounded in intellectual debate, generates a better reforms process. It helps avoid a policy process that is pure power play. The work is better rooted in the landscape of people and institutions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One of the most harmful things that is taking place in the Indian state is announcements that show up on a website in the evening, without any previous notice, and are effective next morning. These impose huge costs upon private persons, and drive up the ex ante fear of policy risk in the minds of firms.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Authoritarian regimes, that neglected the value of feedback, have repeatedly failed in the human experience of thousands of years.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In contrast, democracies look messy. They are riven with debate, dissension, and a tug of war. Power is dispersed across many individuals and many elements of the government. Neutral and intellectual voices weigh in on the conflicts that are played out in the public domain. This policy process is a world of ideas and rational thinking, and not merely an exercise in power play. The continuous debate in an environment of dispersed power is the reason why democracies work well. The continuous process of criticism and debate finds and solves mistakes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Public choice theory encourages us to see that everyone involved in government works for herself, and all policymaking is marred by conflicts. Conflict is the normal state, and we should not be uncomfortable about it. Differences between persons and agencies are normal and healthy, and should be played out in the public domain. Differences arise out of conflicting interests, differences in information sets, and legitimate differences in how information is analysed.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If two people agree on everything, only one is doing the thinking.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the past, Indian policy reform consisted of low-risk projects like dismantling industrial licensing and dismantling barriers to globalization. The analytical clarity on those issues was strong and there was little that could go wrong. But as these first-order ideas are used up, future policy work will not be as unambiguous.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In authoritarian regimes, all achievements belong to the leader, which makes it difficult to ever admit that a mistake was made. When credit is given more accurately, to the cast of thousands that work on any one policy initiative, it is easier for the leadership to accept that things have not worked out well and to introduce course corrections. The best management culture is one in which we get credit for not taking credit. This helps create a healthy environment of trying things, accepting that some did not work, and abandoning or fixing the troubled ones.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The leadership of a private firm fears financial non-performance, which will ultimately lead to the loss of jobs and empire. Persistent weak performance can induce a sale of the firm to a new shareholder, who can impose painful changes upon the firm. Private firms face the threat of a bankruptcy process where the firm can be shut down or fundamentally reorganized. None of these possibilities influence employees in the government. There are rare events where a government agency is closed down. Politicians fear losing elections. Officials have no fear.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Companies have feedback loops where the daily MIS shows how things are faring, where quarterly financial statements are put out, and the stock price is updated in real time. When mistakes are made, they kick off corrections. Governments have no comparable feedback loops.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Firms wield no coercive power. They have to be nice to customers all the time. Governments wield coercive power. The danger of functionaries that mistreat individuals is ever-present. Process design for government organizations involves establishing checks and balances against this threat.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A lot of decisions in private firms can be tactical. Governments become the most effective when they establish rules rather than discretion, and eschew day-to-day tactical responses. Governments are bound by equal treatment (Article 14 of the Constitution of India) while private firms have no such constraint.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Firms tend to work on short time horizons. The best governments work on long time horizons.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A country is not a company.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"During World War II, the British rulers established extreme restrictions upon the Indian economy. After Independence, these evolved into a central planning system. From the late 1980s onward, this has morphed into an ‘administrative state’, the rule by officials who have fine-grained control over the decisions of private persons, with functions that veer into legislative and judicial roles. This involves excessive interference in the lives of private persons. However, for the major part, this is the structure of the Indian state, and to do public policy in India is to operate within the contours of this administrative state.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the SEBI Act, unlike the US Securities Act, prohibits private persons from suing for violations of securities law. Only SEBI has the right to initiate such actions. Victims of securities law violations do not have this right.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"India lacks a class action lawsuit mechanism, so there is no mechanism for (say) the shareholders of Satyam to sue. The design that was adopted in building SEBI was that only SEBI can initiate enforcement actions against a person. This is how we got to the administrative state. Now the difficulties of public management impact upon the enforcement process. Thus, persons who have experienced harm are supplicants before SEBI, requesting SEBI to enforce securities law.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The agenda of liberalization and economic freedom requires going back to the foundations of common law: to a world of contracts, torts, private enforcement and class action lawsuits. This is what is required to scale back the administrative state.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When the courts fail, we get the rule of officials.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is a bias, in India, for muscular responses to current newspaper stories. Letting the field unfold under laissez faire for four years is an unlikely event in the Indian policy process.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Academic journals do not publish policy proposals, hence academic researchers are not keen to invent policy proposals.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Investments in the early stages of the policy pipeline, and in human capacity, have to be in place. Otherwise, a crisis will be wasted. As an example, the rape in Delhi on 16 December 2012 created a political moment for reform of the criminal justice system. However, as the early stages of the pipeline had not been constructed ahead of time, and human capabilities for stages 5, 6 and 7 were weak, the response that was obtained in that terrible moment was weak.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A lot more is possible from the slow process of improving things every day, than is commonly given credit for. The UK got to liberal democracy without anything like a French Revolution. We should not be entranced by dramatic wins; we should have the endurance to engage in ‘the slow boring of hard boards’ over long decades.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In many fields, it is useful to think of state activity under a few pillars of intervention. A government can produce education services by running schools. It can regulate the working of private schools. It can finance private persons buying the services of private schools. These are three pillars of intervention—producing, regulating, financing.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Each of the three pillars involves different kinds of management mechanisms. Positive externalities justify financing. Negative externalities, asymmetric information or market power justify regulating.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Indian state should not just be a mini-Swedish state. There would be many zeroes in the Indian optimization: We would try to go after a smaller set of market failures, where the welfare cost of the free market outcome is particularly large, and where the state capacity required in addressing the market failure is relatively small. Given our capacity constraints today, to quote Kaushik Basu, we have to engage in ‘libertarianism of necessity’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We would argue in favour of the largest possible state that is feasible while achieving competence, and this is likely to be a very small state.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When state capacity is high, a government can embark on more complex plans. When state capacity is low, the only things that will work correctly are simple plans.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the international experience, waging war was an important pathway to developing state capacity. That pathway is not open to India, given the nuclear deterrent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Public choice theory and political science emphasize the dangers of concentration of power. Concentrated power will generally be abused for personal gains by the persons wielding the power. This encourages us to disperse power. Mature democracies work by limiting the power of every player in public life. As an example, the United States president has a narrow (‘enumerated’) list of powers under the US Constitution. Unlike the Indian arrangement, the US president does not even control the annual budget, nor does he control the draft legislation that is tabled for discussion by legislators.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We in India have traditionally been over-optimistic about a benevolent state, and have skimped on the checks and balances that create accountability and performance. We need to take public choice theory to heart, and thereby bring sound procedures into law where agencies and personnel are mistrusted with power, so as to produce better performance by the state apparatus.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"consider the law that creates UIDAI. It has to contain two parts. The first part involves coercing private persons, to say that if they wish to be part of a government welfare programme, they have no choice but to submit to intrusive biometric requirements. The second part involves coercing the officials in UIDAI, and all public and private persons who utilize the UIDAI data, to engage in fair play towards the people. The need for this second part flows from public choice theory, the scepticism about the benevolence of the state.\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/02693e79-fb55-41fa-be8d-95281f61557b.html","relUrl":"notes/02693e79-fb55-41fa-be8d-95281f61557b.html"},{"doc":"Glimpses Of World History","title":"Glimpses Of World History","hpath":"kindle_highlights.glimpses_of_world_history","content":"\n\n\"The year you were born in—1917—was one of the memorable years of history when a great leader, with a heart full of love and sympathy for the poor and suffering, made his people write a noble and never-to-be-forgotten chapter of history.

The Aryans and the Dravidians gave much to each other and took much from each other also, and thus built up a common culture for India.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the mainland of Greece famous cities grew up: Athens and Sparta and Thebes and Corinth. The early days of the Greeks, or the Hellenes as they were called, were celebrated in two famous epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. You know something about these two epics, which in a way correspond to our own epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is that of Croesus of whom you must have heard. To be as rich as Croesus has become a well-known saying in English. You may also have read stories of this Croesus, of how rich and proud he was and how he was humbled. Croesus was the king of a country called Lydia, which was on the west coast of Asia, where Asia Minor is today. Being a country touching the sea, probably there was a great deal of trade there. In his time the Persian Empire under Cyrus was growing and becoming powerful. Cyrus and Croesus came into conflict and Cyrus defeated Croesus.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Rajatarangini,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is likely to become the common language of India.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the Lichchhavi clan. This State was a republic, and was governed by an assembly of notables with an elected president, who was called the Nayaka.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By improving the method of getting food, by making it easier to get it, agriculture changed the whole basis of society. It gave people leisure.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"our ideals should be wholly unselfish, so that we may try to live up to them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"those who are prepared to die for any cause are seldom defeated.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Herodotus thought over it and drew a moral from it. He says that a nation’s history has three stages: success; then as a consequence of success, arrogance and injustice; and then, as a consequence of these, downfall.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The power of Athens grew; and here is evidence—and there is proof of it everywhere—that liberty is a good thing. While the Athenians were despotically governed, they were not superior in war to any of their neighbours, but when they got rid of their despot, they far surpassed them. This shows that in subjection they did not exert themselves, but they were working for a master, but when they became free each individual keenly did his best on his own account.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In this book, the Shahnamah of Firdausi, it is interesting to find numerous references to Indian swords and daggers being used by the Persian King and nobles. This indicates that even in Alexander’s day India was making swords of fine steel, which were welcomed in foreign countries.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kings are disappearing from this world of ours. There are very few left, and they too will go soon enough. It is interesting, however, to see that the idea of kingship in ancient India meant service of the people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Takshashila or Taxila in the far north, near Peshawar; Mathura, vulgarly spelt Muttra now by the English; Ujjain in Central India; and Nalanda near Patna in Bihar\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Hospitals especially meant for them were erected, and animal-sacrifice was forbidden.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“All sects deserve reverence for one reason or another. By thus acting a man exalts his own sect and at the same time does service to the sects of other people.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"after the death of Alexander his empire was divided up by his generals. There were three principal divisions: (1) Western Asia, Persia, and Mesopotamia, under Seleucus; (2) Egypt under Ptolemy; and (3) Macedonia, under Antigonus.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Alexandria was the capital of the Ptolemys in Egypt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the Duke of Ch’in, managed to drive out the ancient and effete Chou dynasty. His descendants are called the Ch’in dynasty, and it is interesting to note that the name China is derived from this Ch’in.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"His name was Wang Cheng, but later he adopted another name—Shih Huang Ti—and he is usually known by his second name, which means “The First Emperor”.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the great Ch’ins rose and triumphed and ruled a powerful empire, and decayed and ended—all in a brief fifty years. Shih Huang Ti was to have been the first of a great line of powerful emperors, and yet three years after his death in 209 BC, his dynasty came to an end. And soon, after all, the books and the classics of Confucius were dug out of hiding,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It was he who started building the Great Wall. This was an expensive job. But the Chinese apparently preferred spending money over this wall, which was to protect them from foreign enemies, to keeping a large standing army for defence. The Wall could hardly prevent a big invasion. All it did was to stop petty raids. It shows, however, that the Chinese wanted peace and, in spite of their strength, were not lovers of military glory.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The second noteworthy fact was the introduction of the examination system for public officials.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There were three wars between them—the Punic Wars they are called. The first Punic War lasted twenty-three years from 264 to 241 BC and ended in a victory for Rome. Twenty-two years later came the second Punic War, and Carthage sent a general, famous in history, named Hannibal. For fifteen years Hannibal harassed Rome and terrorized the Roman people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even the poor, down-trodden slaves rose in revolt under a gladiator named Spartacus. But they were crushed ruthlessly, and it is said that 6000 of them were crucified on the Appian Way in Rome.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Today the Mahayana form of Buddhism exists in China, Japan and Tibet; the Hinayana exists in Ceylon and Burma.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Roman people were not intolerant so far as religions went, for the Empire tolerated all religions, and even if someone chose to blaspheme or curse any of the gods, he was not punished. As one of the emperors, Tiberius, said: “If the gods are insulted, let them see to it themselves.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"They were hostile to all other religions and they refused absolutely to worship the Emperor’s image.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As a religion, they might have tolerated Christianity, but the Christian refusal to pay homage to the Emperor’s image was looked upon as political treason and was made punishable with death.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One party said that the word Homo-ousion should be used in a prayer; the other wanted Homoi-ousion—this difference had reference to the divinity of Jesus. Over this diphthong fierce war was raged and large numbers of people were slaughtered.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Three hundred years after Augustus Caesar, an emperor named Constantine took a great step which was to have far-reaching consequences. He actually shifted the seat of his empire from Rome to the East. Near an old city called Byzantium on the shores of the Bosphorus, between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, he founded a new city, which he called, after himself, Constantinople. Constantinople, or New Rome as it was also called, became then the capital and seat of the Roman Empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"there is one other strong resemblance between the Romans and the English people—they are both singularly devoid of imagination!\"\n\n---------\n\n\"was this Pallava government that seems to have organized this colonization of Malaysia.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He tells us that the people of Magadha were happy and prosperous; that justice was mildly administered; and that there was no death penalty.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Tang dynasty was started by the Emperor Kao Tsu in 618 AC. Not only did he unite the whole of China, but he spread his authority over an immense area—over Annam and Cambodia in the south and right up to Persia and the Caspian Sea in the west. Part of Korea was also included in this mighty empire. The capital of the Empire was Si-an-Fu, a city which was famous in eastern Asia for its splendour and culture. Embassies and commissions came to it from Japan and southern Korea, which was still free, to study its arts, philosophy, and civilization.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Arabs were permitted to build a mosque in Canton. This mosque still exists, although it is 1300 years old, and is one of the oldest mosques in the world.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Tangs lasted for 300 years, till 907 AC. These 300 years are said by some to be China’s greatest period, when there was not only a high level of culture, but a high level of general happiness for the people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"how a Chinese exile named Ki-Tse, not approving of a change of dynasty in China, marched eastwards with 5000 followers. He settled down in Korea, calling it “Chosen”—the Land of the Morning Calm. This was in 1122 BC. Ki-Tse brought with him Chinese arts and crafts, agriculture and silk-making. For over 900 years Ki-Tse’s descendants ruled Chosen.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We find that a certain Empress Jingo was head of Yamato State about 200 AC. Yamato was the original name of Japan, or that part of it where these immigrants had settled.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Harsha-Vardhana made Kanauj his capital. Being himself a poet and dramatist, he gathered round himself a host of poets and artists, and Kanauj became a famous city. Harsha was a keen Buddhist. Buddhism, as a separate faith, had weakened greatly in India; it was being swallowed up by the Brahmans. Harsha appears to have been the last great Buddhist sovereign in India.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Many years he spent in India, especially in the great university of Nalanda, which was not far from Pataliputra. Nalanda, which was a monastery and university combined, is said to have had as many as 10,000 students and monks in residence. It was the great centre of Buddhist learning, a rival to Benares, which was the stronghold of Brahman learning.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Hiuen gives us a description of the great Kumbh Mela at Prayag.3 When you see this mela again, think of Hiuen Tsang’s visit to it 1300 years ago, and remember that even then it was an old mela coming right down from the Vedic times.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As a pious Buddhist, Harsha stopped the killing of animals for food.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A striking feature of India in those days was the great deference and respect shown by rulers and military men to learned and cultured people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"King Harsha died in 648 AC.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the west and centre there is the Chalukyan kingdom, largely consisting of the Maharashtra country, with Badami as their capital. Hiuen Tsang praises the Maharashtrians and speaks highly of their courage. They are “warlike and proud-spirited, grateful for favours and revengeful for wrongs”. The Chalukyans had to hold Harsha in the north, the Pallavas in the south, and Kalinga (Orissa) in the east.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We have another book which helps us a little to form an idea of India in the Middle Ages. This is the Nitisara of Shukracharya. This is not so good or helpful as the Arthashastra, but with its help and that of some inscriptions and other accounts we shall try to open a window into the ninth or tenth century after Christ.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Nitisara tells us that “neither through colour, nor through ancestors can the spirit worthy of a Brahman be generated”. Thus, according to it, caste division should not be by birth, but by capacity. Again, it says: “In making official appointments work, character, and merit were to be regarded—neither caste nor family”.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"it is interesting to notice that in Indian polity in the Middle Ages, as before, autocracy or the divine right of kings had no place.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We find that the kings and rulers were far from being autocratic rulers. Their power was kept in check by elected panchayats. We find also that there was a fairly advanced system of self-government in the villages and towns, and that there was little interference with this by the Central Government.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"although there was no labour slavery in India as in the West, our whole social structure was one of gradations— one class over another.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"About 1300 AC the mouth of the river Mekong became blocked by deposits of mud. The waters of the river could not flow through, and they backed up and flooded the entire region round the great city, turning fertile fields into a great area of useless marshlands. The large population of the city began to starve. It could not stay on, and was forced to leave the city and migrate. So “Angkor the Magnificent” was abandoned, and the jungle came and took possession of it, and its wonderful buildings housed wild animals for a while, till the jungle reduced the palaces to dust and reigned unchallenged.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The imperial forces would have been no match for him, but the Germanic tribes, the “barbarians” of the Romans, were frightened at this Hun invasion, and so the Franks and Goths joined the imperial army and together they fought the Huns under Attila at a great battle at Troyes. Over 150,000 people are said to have been killed at this battle, at which Attila was defeated and the Mongolian Huns repulsed. This was in 451 AC.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Her past history had led other peoples to think of her as the leader of the world, and they treated her with respect and almost with superstitious fear. So Rome continued, outwardly as the powerful mistress of an empire, but in reality with no strength behind her. There was outward calm, and there were crowds in her theatres and stadiums and market-places. But inevitably she was heading for collapse, not merely because she was weak, but because she had built up a rich man’s civilization on the misery and slavery of the masses.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Islam was the new force or idea which woke up the Arabs and filled them with self-confidence and energy. This was a religion started by a new prophet, Mohammad, who was born in Mecca in 570 AC. He was in no hurry to start this religion. He lived a quiet life, liked and trusted by his fellow-citizens. Indeed, he was known as “Al-Amin”—the Trusty. But when he started preaching his new religion, and especially when he preached against the idols at Mecca, there was a loud outcry against him, and ultimately he was driven out of Mecca, barely escaping with his life. Above all he laid stress on the claim that there was only one God, and that he, Mohammad, was the Prophet of God.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Within seven years of the flight, Mohammad returned to Mecca as its master. Even before this he sent out from Medina a summons to the kings and rulers of the world to acknowledge the one God and his Prophet.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Mohammad died in 632 AC, ten years after the Hijrat. He had succeeded in making a nation out of the many warring tribes of Arabia and in firing them with enthusiasm for a cause. He was succeeded by Abu Bakr, a member of his family, as Khalifa or Caliph or chief. This succession used to be by a kind of informal election at a public meeting. Two years later Abu Bakr died, and was succeeded by Omar, who was Khalifa for ten years.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even in these short dozen years, during which Abu Bakr and Omar ruled, the Arabs defeated both the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanid King of Persia. Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jews and Christians, was occupied by the Arabs, and the whole of Syria and Iraq and Persia became part of the new Arabian Empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"So, in about 100 years from the death of Mohammad, the Arab Empire spread from the south of France and Spain right across northern Africa to Suez, and across Arabia and Persia and Central Asia to the borders of Mongolia.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Charles Martel was the leader of this coalition and in 732 AC he defeated them at the battle of Tours in France. This defeat saved Europe from the Arabs. “On the plains of Tours,” a historian has said, “the Arabs lost the empire of the world when almost in their grasp.” There can be no doubt that if the Arabs had won at Tours, European history would have been tremendously changed. There was no one else to stop them in Europe and they could have marched right across to Constantinople and put an end to the Eastern Roman Empire and the other States on the way. Instead of Christianity, Islam would then have become the religion of Europe, and all manner of other changes might have taken place.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Ali, the husband of Fatima, who was the daughter of Mohammad, was Khalifa for a short while. But there was continuous conflict. Ali was murdered, and some time later his son Hussain, with his family, were massacred on the plain of Karbala. It is this tragedy of Karbala that is mourned year after year in the month of Moharram by the Muslims,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It amazes me to think that some people put up with this barbarity still. Whenever I think of the women in purdah, cut off from the outside world, I invariably think of a prison or a zoo! How can a nation go ahead if half of its population is kept hidden away in a kind of prison? Fortunately, India is rapidly tearing the purdah away. Even Muslim society has largely rid itself of this terrible burden.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"across Asia in Mongolia there arose Chengiz Khan, the Mongol Shaker of the Earth, as he was called, who was indeed going to shake Asia and Europe. He and his descendants finally put an end to Baghdad and its empire. By the time the Mongols had finished with the great and famous city of Baghdad, it was almost a heap of dust and ashes and most of its 2,000,000 inhabitants were dead. This was in 1258 AC.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This wielder of the sword who came to India with fire and slaughter was Mahmud of Ghazni.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Year after year he raided India and sacked and killed and took away with him vast treasure and large numbers of captives. Altogether he made seventeen raids and only one of these—into Kashmir—was a failure. The others were successful, and he became a terror all over the north. He went as far south as Pataliputra, Mathura and Somnath. From Thaneshwara he took away, it is said, 200,000 captives and vast wealth. But it was in Somnath that he got the most treasure. For this was one of the great temples, and the offerings of centuries had accumulated there. It is said that thousands of people took refuge in the temple when Mahmud approached, in the hope that a miracle would happen and the god they worshipped would protect them. But miracles seldom occur, except in the imaginations of the faithful, and the temple was broken and looted by Mahmud and 50,000 people perished, waiting for the miracle which did not happen. Mahmud died in 1030 AC.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"on Christmas day 800 AC there was a great ceremony in the Cathedral when the Pope crowned Charlemagne Roman Emperor. From that day began the Holy Roman Empire\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The cry of religion has paid often enough.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He was Wang An-Shih, a prime minister of the Sungs in the eleventh century. China was, as I have told you, a land governed by the ideas of Confucius. All officials had to pass examinations in the Confucian classics, and nobody dared to go against anything that Confucius had said. Wang An-Shih did not go against them, but he interpreted them in a remarkable way. That is a way clever people have of getting round a difficulty. Some of Wang’s ideas were remarkably modern. His whole object was to lessen the burden of taxation on the poor and increase it on the rich who could afford to pay. He lowered the land taxes and permitted the peasants to pay them in kind—that is, in grain or other produce—if they found payment in money difficult. On the rich he levied an income-tax. This is supposed to be quite a modern tax, and yet we find it proposed in China 900 years ago.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The two chief Daimyo families were the Taira and the Minamoto. They helped the Emperor in suppressing the Fujiwaras in 1156 AC. But then they attacked each other. The Tairas won, and, perhaps to make sure that the rival family would not trouble them in future, they killed them. They killed all the leading Minamotos except four children, one of these being a twelve-year-old boy, Yoritomo. The Taira family, in spite of their attempts, had not been thorough enough. This boy Yoritomo, who was spared as of no great consequence, grew up a bitter enemy of the Taira family, full of the desire for vengeance. He succeeded. He drove them out of the capital, and then smashed them up at a naval battle.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Yoritomo now became all powerful, and the Emperor gave him the high-sounding title of Sei-i-tai-Shogun, which means the Barbarian-subduing-great-general. This was in 1192 AC. The title was hereditary, and with it went full power to govern. The Shogun was the real ruler. In this way began the Shogunate in Japan. It was to last a very long time, nearly 700 years, almost to recent times,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"he established his military capital at Kamakura, and this first Shogunate is called therefore the Kamakura Shogunate. It lasted till 1333 AC, that is, for nearly 150 years.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Civilizations, like empires, fall, not so much because of the strength of the enemy outside, as through the weakness and decay within. Rome fell not because of the barbarians; they merely knocked down something that was already dead. The heart of Rome had ceased beating when the arms and legs were cut off. We see something of this process in India and China and in the case of the Arabs. The collapse of Arabian civilization was sudden, even as their rise had been. In India and China the process is long-drawn-out and it is not easy to spot it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is a little dangerous to live in a society which is closed up like a shell. We petrify there and grow unaccustomed to fresh air and fresh ideas. Fresh air is as necessary for societies as for individuals.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Such a solution can only mean the ending of poverty and misery everywhere. This may take a long time, but we must aim at this, and at nothing less than this. Only then can we have real culture and civilization based on equality, where there is no exploitation of any country or class. Such a society will be a creative and progressive society, adapting itself to changing circumstances, and basing itself on the co-operation of its members. And ultimately it must spread all over the world.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In another 100 years another people came on the scene. These were the Aztecs from Mexico. Early in the fourteenth century they conquered the Maya country and about 1325 AC they founded the city of Tenochtitlan. Soon this became the capital city of the whole Mexican world, the centre of the Empire of the Aztecs, with a vast population.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Early in the sixteenth century (in 1519), when the Aztecs were apparently at the height of their power, the whole empire came down with a crash before a handful of foreign bandits and adventurers! This is one of the most amazing examples of the collapse of an empire. And this was brought about by a Spaniard, Hernan Cortés, and a small troop with him. Cortés was a brave man, and daring enough. He had two things which were of great help to him—firearms and horses. Apparently there were no horses in the Mexican Empire, and there were certainly no firearms. But neither Cortés’s courage nor his guns and horses would have availed him if the Aztec Empire had not been rotten at heart. It had decayed inside, just keeping the outer form, and even a little kick was enough to bring it down. The empire was based on exploitation and was much resented by the people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In South America there was another seat of civilization in Peru, and the Inca ruled it. He was a kind of divine monarch. It is strange that this Peruvian civilization was, in its later days at least, completely cut off from the Mexican civilization. They were not far from each other, and yet they knew nothing of each other, and this itself shows their remarkable backwardness in some respects. A Spaniard also put an end to this Peruvian State soon after Cortés had succeeded in Mexico. This was Pizarro. He came in 1530 and he seized the Inca by treachery. The seizure of the “divine” monarch itself terrified the people. Pizarro tried to rule in the name of the Inca for some time and extorted vast wealth. Later this pretence was ended and the Spaniards made Peru a part of their dominions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in the Indus Valley we go back not only 5000 years but many more thousands, till we are lost in the dim mists of antiquity when man first settled down.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"another great charge brought against the “Moriscos” was that they were tolerant in religion. It is extraordinary to read of this, and yet this was one of the main charges in an account of the “Apostacies and Treasons of the Moriscos” drawn up by the Archbishop of Valencia in 1602, when he was recommending the expulsion of Saracens from Spain. Referring to this he says, “that they [the Moriscos] commended nothing so much as that liberty of conscience in all matters of religion, which the Turks, and all other Mohammedans, suffer their subjects to enjoy”. What a great compliment was thus paid unwittingly to the Saracens in Spain,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For centuries Spain had been the centre of civilization, the seat of arts and sciences, of learning and every form of refined enlightenment. No other country in Europe had so far approached the cultivated dominion of the Moors. The brief brilliancy of Ferdinand and Isabella, and of the Empire of Charles, could found no such enduring pre-eminence. The Moors were banished; for a while Christian Spain shone, like the moon, with a borrowed light; then came the eclipse, and in that darkness Spain has grovelled ever since.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Thus began the Crusades in 1095 AC, and for more than 150 years the struggle continued between Christianity and Islam, between the Cross and the Crescent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The chief result of the Crusades was to bring death and misery to millions of Christians and Muslims and again to soak Asia Minor and Palestine with human blood.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Politicians usually hide their real reasons and talk pompously of religion and justice and truth and the like. It was so at the time of the Crusades. It is so still.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is a story that once Richard was very ill and was suffering from the heat. Saladin, hearing of this, arranged to send him fresh snow and ice from the mountains.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There are many stories of the time of the Crusades. Perhaps you have read Walter Scott’s Talisman.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The last Crusade took place in 1249. It was headed by Louis IX, King of France, who was defeated and taken prisoner.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Frederick I of Hohenstaufen became Emperor in 1152. He is usually called Frederick Barbarossa. He it was who got drowned on his way to the Crusades.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"grandson of Frederick Barbarossa was also called Frederick. He became Emperor at an early age and was called Frederick II. He was the man who was called stupor mundi, the Wonder of the World, and who went to Palestine and had a friendly talk with the Egyptian Sultan. He also, like his grandfather, defied the Pope and refused to obey him. The Pope retaliated by excommunicating him.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This was the signing of the Magna Carta by King John in 1215 AC. John had succeeded his brother, Richard Coeur de Lion. He was very grasping, but he was also weak and he succeeded in irritating everybody. The nobles cornered him at the island of Runnymede in the Thames and, almost at the sword’s point, forced him to sign this Magna Carta, or Great Charter, which contained a promise that he would respect certain liberties of the nobles and people of England.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is interesting to note that this rule laid down in England over 700 years ago does not apply to India even in 1932 under British rule. Today one individual, the Viceroy, has power to issue Ordinances, framing laws and depriving people of their liberty and their property.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"national council gradually grew up to which knights and citizens were sent from the different country areas and the cities. This was the beginning of the English Parliament. The knights and citizens came to form the Commons’ House; the nobles and the bishops formed the Lords’ House. This Parliament had little power to begin with, but this grew gradually. Ultimately there came the final test between the King and Parliament, as to who was supreme. The King lost his head, and Parliament became undisputed master. But this was to take place after nearly 400 years, in the seventeenth century.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Last came the Ottoman Turks and to them fell the great prize of the imperial city of Constantinople in 1453 AC. And with the fall of the city, fell also the Eastern Empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For another 150 years or more after Mahmud, neither Muslim conquest nor Islam made much progress in India.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"An Afghan chief had arisen in Afghanistan, who captured Ghazni and put an end to the Ghaznavite Empire. He is called Shahab-ud-din Ghuri (Ghur being some little town in Afghanistan). He came down to Lahore, took possession of it, and then marched to Delhi. The King of Delhi was Prithvi Raj Chauhan, and under his leadership many other chiefs of northern India fought against the invader and defeated him utterly. But only for a while. Shahab-ud-din returned next year with a great force, and this time he defeated and killed Prithvi Raj.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Thus in 1192 AC was won the first great victory by Shahab-ud-din, which resulted in the establishment of Muslim rule in India.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It was not a question of a Muslim killing a Hindu because of his religion; but a question of an alien conqueror trying to break the spirit of the conquered. Religion is almost always brought in to explain these acts of cruelty, but this is not correct. Sometimes religion was used as a pretext. But the real causes were political or social. The people from Central Asia, who invaded India, were fierce and merciless even in their homelands and long before they were converted to Islam. Having conquered a new country, they knew only one way of keeping it under control—the way of terror.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The first effect of the Muslim invasion was an exodus of people to the south. After Mahmud’s raids and massacres, Islam was associated in northern India with barbarous cruelty and destruction. So when the new invasion came and could not be checked, crowds of skilled craftsmen and learned men went to southern India. This gave a great impetus to Aryan culture in the south.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"About the time of the Afghan invasions in northern India, the Cholas were dominant in southern India. Soon, however, they began to decline, and a little kingdom, which was subordinate to them, became independent and grew in power. This was the Pandya kingdom, with Madura for its capital and Kayal as its port. A famous traveller from Venice, Marco Polo, about whom I shall have something more to say later, visited Kayal, the port, twice, in 1288 and in 1293. He describes the town as “a great and noble city”, full of ships from Arabia and China, and humming with business. Marco himself came by ship from China.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"After Shahab-ud-din, the Afghan, who defeated Prithvi Raj, there came a succession of Sultans of Delhi called the Slave Kings. The first of them was Qutub-ud-din. He had been a slave of Shahab-ud-din, but even slaves could rise to high positions, and he managed to become the first Sultan of Delhi.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It was during the reign of Iltutmish (from 1211 to 1236) that a great and terrifying cloud hovered over the frontiers of India. This was composed of the Mongols under Chengiz Khan. Right up to the Indus he came, pursuing an enemy, but there he stopped. India escaped him. It was nearly 200 years later that another of his breed, Timur, came down to India to massacre and destroy. But although Chengiz did not come, many Mongols made a practice of raiding India, and even coming right up to Lahore. They spread terror and frightened even the Sultans, who sometimes bribed them off. Many thousands of them settled down in the Punjab.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Slave kings ended in 1290. Soon after came Ala-ud-din Khilji, who came to the throne by the gentle method of murdering his uncle, who was also his father-in-law. He followed this up by having all the Muslim nobles whom he suspected of disloyalty killed. Fearing a Mongol plot, he ordered that every Mongol in his territories should be killed, so that “not one of the stock should be left alive upon the face of the earth”. And so 20,000 or 30,000 of them, most of them of course quite innocent, were massacred.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the people of the country, the Hindus, were being slowly converted to Islam. The process was not rapid. Some changed their religion because Islam appealed to them, some did so because of fear, some because it is natural to want to be on the winning side.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"People who were not Muslims had to pay a special tax, a poll tax—jezia, as it was called. This was a great burden on the poor. Many would change their religion just to escape it. Among the higher classes desire to gain Court favour and high office was a powerful motive. Ala-ud-din’s great general, Malik Kafur, who conquered the south, was a convert from Hinduism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"his most famous exploit was his decision to ruin Delhi, his own capital, because some of the people of the city had dared to criticize his policy in anonymous notices. He ordered that the capital should be transferred from Delhi to Deoghiri in the south (in Hyderabad State now). This place he called Daulatabad.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This was the person who is known as Chengiz Khan (or Genghiz or Jenghiz or Jengiz Khan—there are many ways of spelling it). He was born in 1155 AC and his original name was Timuchin. His father, Yesugei-Bagatur, died when he was a little boy. “Bagatur”, by the way, was a favourite name for Mongol nobles. It means “hero” and I suppose the Urdu bahadur comes from it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A Secret History of the Mongol People written in the thirteenth century, and published in China in the fourteenth century, describes this election: “And so, when all the generations living in felt tents became united under a single authority, in the year of the Leopard, they assembled near the sources of the Onan, and raising the White Banner on Nine Legs, they conferred on Chengiz the title of Kagan.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This also reminds us that Chengiz did not simply dash across Asia in a fit of youthful enthusiasm. He was a cautious and careful middle-aged man, and every big thing he did was preceded by thought and preparation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If they won great victories on the field of battle, it was not because of their numbers, but because of their discipline and organization. And above all it was due to the brilliant captainship of Chengiz. For Chengiz is, without doubt, the greatest military genius and leader in history. Alexander and Caesar seem petty before him. Chengiz was not only himself a very great commander, but he trained many of his generals and made them brilliant leaders.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This march, begun in 1219, opened the eyes of Asia, and partly of Europe too, to this new terror, this great roller which came on inexorably, crushing down cities and men by the million. The Empire of Khwarazm ceased to exist. The great city of Bokhara, full of palaces, and with over a million population, was reduced to ashes. Samarqand, the capital, was destroyed, and out of a million people that lived there, only 50,000 remained alive. Herat, Balkh and many other flourishing cities were all destroyed. Millions were killed.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Chengiz died in 1227 at the age of seventy-two. His empire extended from the Black Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean, and it was still vigorous and growing. His capital was still the little town of Karakorum in Mongolia. Nomad as he was, he was an extremely able organizer, and he was wise enough to employ able ministers to help him. His empire, so rapidly conquered, did not break up at his death.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Right across Asia and Europe the mighty Mongol Empire sprawled. There had never been in history anything to compare with the Mongol conquests; there had never been such a vast empire. The Mongols must indeed have seemed at the time the lords of the world. India was free from them at the time simply because they had not gone that way. Western Europe, just about the size of India, was also outside the Empire. But all these places existed almost on sufferance, and only so long as the Mongols did not take it into their heads to swallow them up. So it must have seemed in the thirteenth century.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kublai Khan died in 1292. After him there was no Great Khan.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Travels of Marco Polo\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Great Khan, Kublai, died soon after Marco Polo left him. The Yuan dynasty, which he had founded in China, did not long survive him. The Mongol power declined rapidly, and there was a Chinese nationalist wave against the foreigner. Within sixty years the Mongols had been driven out from South China, and a Chinaman had established himself as Emperor at Nanking. In another dozen years—in 1368—the Yuan dynasty fell finally and the Mongols were driven beyond the Great Wall. Another great Chinese dynasty—the “Tai Ming” dynasty—comes upon the scene now. For a long period, nearly 300 years, this dynasty ruled in China, and this period is looked upon as one of good government, prosperity and culture.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Church started the reign of violence in religion, formally and officially, in 1233, by starting what is called the Inquisition. This was a kind of court which inquired into the orthodoxy of people’s beliefs, and if they did not come up to the standard, their usual punishment was death by burning. There was a regular hunt for “heretics”, and hundreds of them were burnt at the stake. Even worse than this burning was the torture inflicted on them to make them recant. Many poor unfortunate women were accused of being witches and were burnt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To call a starving man free is but to mock him.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Only in one country can it be said that economic freedom has been won by the people generally, and that is Russia, or rather the Soviet Union.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In India there was no such fight for freedom of conscience because from the earliest days this right never seems to have been denied. People could believe in almost anything they liked and there was no compulsion.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"You know something of Jeanne d’Arc (or Joan of Arc), the Maid of Orleans. She is a heroine of yours. She gave confidence to her dispirited people and inspired them to great endeavour, and under her lead they drove out the English from their country. But for all this the reward she got was a trial and sentence of the Inquisition and the stake. The English got hold of her, and they made the Church condemn her, and then in the market-place of Rouen they burnt her in 1430. Many years later the Roman Church sought to undo what had been done by reversing the decision condemning her; and long afterwards they made her a saint!\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The date of the fall of Constantinople is a great date in history. It is supposed to be the end of one era and the beginning of another. The Middle Ages are over. The 1000 years of the Dark Ages end, and there is a quickening in Europe, and fresh life and energy are visible. This is called the beginning of the Renaissance—the rebirth of learning and art.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the course of our wanderings through past ages we have seen many invasions of Europe by Asia. There were some invasions of Asia by Europe, but they were of little moment. Alexander went across Asia to India without any great result. The Romans never went beyond Mesopotamia. Europe, on the other hand, was repeatedly overrun by Asiatic tribes from the earliest times. Of these Asiatic invasions the Ottoman invasion of Europe was the last.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"You will remember that Kublai Khan was the last Great Khan. After his death in 1292 the vast empire, which stretched right across Asia from Korea to Poland and Hungary in Europe, split up into five empires. Each of these five empires was in reality a very big empire. In a previous letter (No. 68) I have given you the names of these five.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the far west was the Empire of the Golden Horde—what a fascinating name these people had! The Russian nobles paid tribute to it for nearly 200 years after Kublai’s death. At the end of this period (1480) the Empire was weakening a little and the Grand Duke of Moscow, who had managed to become the chief Russian noble, refused to pay tribute. This Grand Duke is called Ivan the Great. In the north of Russia there was the old republic of Novgorod, which was controlled by merchants and traders. Ivan defeated this republic and added it to his dukedom. Constantinople meanwhile had fallen to the Turks and the family of the old emperors had been driven out. Ivan married a girl of this old imperial family, and thus claimed to be in the imperial line and an heir to old Byzantium. The Russian Empire, which was finally ended by the revolutions of 1917, began in this way, under Ivan the Great.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"His grandson, who was very cruel, and was therefore called Ivan the Terrible, gave himself the title of Tsar, which was the equivalent of Caesar or Emperor.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The wealth of India attracted this savage. He had some difficulty in inducing his generals and nobles to agree to his proposal to invade India. There was a great council in Samarqand, and the nobles objected to going to India because of the great heat there. Ultimately Timur promised that he would not stay in India. He would just plunder and destroy and return. He kept his word.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"when Timur came with an army of Mongols there was no great resistance and he went on gaily with his massacres and pyramids. Both Hindus and Muslims were slain. No distinction seems to have been made. The prisoners becoming a burden, he ordered all of them to be killed and 100,000 were massacred. At one place, it is said, both the Hindus and Muslims jointly performed the Rajput ceremony of jauhar—marching out to die in battle.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"After Timur’s departure, Delhi was a city of the dead. Famine and pestilence reigned unchecked. There was no ruler or organization or order for two months. There were few inhabitants. Even the man Timur had appointed as his Viceroy in Delhi retired to Multan.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Certainly the world is more civilized and cultured now. Why, then, do we relapse back into barbarism during periods of war? Because war itself is a negation and denial of civilization and culture, except in so far as it takes advantage of the civilized brain to invent and use more and more powerful and horrible weapons.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Timur, as we have seen, was one of the worst afflictions that befell India.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Let us look at the India of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The Delhi Sultanate shrinks till it vanishes away on Timur’s coming. There are a number of large independent States all over India, mostly Muslim; but there is one powerful Hindu State—Vijayanagar—in the south.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"right through history, from the earliest times, reformers have risen in Hinduism, who have tried to rid it of its abuses. Buddha was the greatest of these. I have also told you of Shankaracharya, who lived in the eighth century. Three hundred years later, in the eleventh century, there lived in the south, in the Chola Empire, another great reformer who was the leader of a rival school of thought to that of Shankara. His name was Ramanuja.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Ramanand, who lived in the south in the fourteenth century, was the first well-known teacher who preached this synthesis. He preached against caste and ignored it. Among his disciples was a Muslim weaver named Kabir, who became even more famous later on. Kabir became very popular. His songs in Hindi, as you perhaps know, are very well known now even in remote villages in the north. He was neither Hindu nor Muslim; he was both, or something between the two, and his followers came from both religions and all castes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A little after Kabir there rose another great reformer and religious leader in the north. This was Guru Nanak, who was the founder of Sikhism. He was followed, one after the other, by the ten gurus of the Sikhs, the last of whom was Guru Govind Singh.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One other name, famous in Indian religious and cultural history, I should like to mention here. This was Chaitanya, a famous scholar of Bengal early in the sixteenth century, who suddenly decided that his scholarship was not worthwhile and left it, and took to the ways of faith. He became a great bhakta, who went about singing bhajans with his disciples all over Bengal. He founded also a Vaishnavite order, and his influence is still great in Bengal.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On the plains of Panipat, near Delhi, in 1526, Babar won the Empire of Hindustan. A great empire rose again, known as the Moghal Empire of India, and Delhi again attained prominence and became the seat of this empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In Jaunpur, newly founded, there was a small Muslim State ruled by the Sharqi kings. It was not big and powerful, and politically it was not important. But for nearly 100 years in the fifteenth century it was a great seat of culture and toleration in religion. The Muslim colleges of Jaunpur spread these ideas of toleration, and one of the rulers even tried to bring about that synthesis between Hindus and Muslims of which I wrote to you in my last letter.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The city of Vijayanagar, he says, is as “large as Rome and very beautiful to the sight”. He describes at length the wonders of the city, and the charms of its innumerable lakes and waterways and fruit gardens. It is, he says, “the best-provided city in the world . . . for the state of the city is not like that of other cities, which often fail of supplies and provisions, for in this everything abounds.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Vijayanagar was defeated by this league of States in 1565. There was terrible slaughter, and the sack of the great city followed soon after.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Hung Wu was the first Emperor of the new Ming dynasty. His son, Yung Lo, was also a great ruler. He was Emperor from 1402 to 1424. But I must not inflict these Chinese names upon you. There were several good rulers and then, as usually happens, there was deterioration. But let us forget the emperors and consider this period in China’s history. It is a bright period, and there is a singular charm about it. The word “Ming” itself means bright. The Ming dynasty lasted for 276 years—from 1368 to 1644. It is the most typically Chinese of all dynasties, and during their rule the genius of the Chinese people had full scope.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China at the end of the fifteenth century was far ahead of Europe in wealth, industry, and culture. During the whole of the Ming period, no country in Europe or elsewhere could compare with China in the happiness and artistic activity of its people. And remember that this covered the great Renaissance period in Europe.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the Manchus would have had great difficulty in conquering China if China had not been split up into rival factions. Foreign invasions in almost every country—China, India, etc.—have always succeeded because of the weakness of that country and the internal conflicts of its people. So in China there were disturbances all over the country.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The general of the Mings who was leading the armies against the Manchus was Wu San-Kwei. He was hard put to it to know what to do between the brigand emperor and the Manchus. Very foolishly, or perhaps traitorously, he asked the Manchus to help him against the brigand. The Manchus gladly did so—and of course remained in Peking! Wu San-Kwei then, convinced of the helplessness of the Ming cause, deserted it and joined the foreign invaders, the Manchus.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If the government was as good as it is supposed to be, why were there revolts and internal troubles? Why could not the foreign invaders from Manchuria be stopped? Probably the government became oppressive towards the end. And it may be that too much parental government weakened the people. Spoon-feeding is not good for children or nations.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"You can compare the two to a cultured person of middle age, rather fond of a quiet life, not keen on new adventure and a disturbance of his routine, busy with his classics and his art; and a young boy, rather uncouth, but full of energy and inquiry and seeking adventure everywhere.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in 1636, Japan was sealed up. The Portuguese were expelled; all Japanese, Christians or non-Christians, were forbidden to go abroad for any reason whatsoever; and no Japanese living abroad could return to Japan, on pain of death!\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For over 200 years Japan was almost completely cut off from the world, even from its neighbours, China and Korea.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Another tendency to be noticed in India is the desire to look back and not forward; to the heights we once occupied and not to the heights we hope to occupy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Within two years, in 1642, civil war began, the King on one side, supported by many nobles and a great part of the army, the Parliament on the other, supported by the rich merchants and the city of London. For several years this war dragged on, till there arose on the side of Parliament a great leader, Oliver Cromwell. He was a great organizer, a stern disciplinarian and a man full of religious enthusiasm for the cause. “In the dark perils of war,” says Carlyle about Cromwell, “in the high places of the field, hope shone in him like a pillar of fire, when it had gone out in all the others.” Cromwell built up a new army, the “Ironsides” they were called, and filled them with his own disciplined enthusiasm. The “Puritans” of the army of Parliament faced the “Cavaliers” of Charles. Cromwell won in the end, and Charles, the King, became a prisoner of Parliament.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"England was for the first time a republic, and Cromwell and his army were there to defend her. Cromwell was practically a dictator. He was called the “Lord Protector” Under his stern and efficient rule England’s strength grew and her fleets drove away the Dutch and French and Spanish fleets. For the first time England became the chief naval Power in Europe.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He abolished the jizya poll tax on non-Muslims and the tax on Hindu pilgrims. He married himself a girl of a noble Rajput family; later he married his son to a Rajput girl also; and he encouraged such mixed marriages. He appointed Rajput nobles to the highest posts in his Empire. Several of his bravest generals and most capable ministers and governors were Hindus. Raja Man Singh was even sent for a while as governor to Kabul.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Then came the fifth guru, Arjun Singh, who compiled the Granth, which is a collection of sayings and hymns, and is the sacred book of the Sikhs. For a political offence Jahangir had Arjun Singh tortured to death.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Under their sixth guru, Hargovind, they became a military brotherhood, and from that time onwards they were often in conflict with the ruling power. Guru Hargovind was himself imprisoned for ten years by Jahangir. The ninth guru was Tegh Bahadur, who lived in Aurangzeb’s reign. He was ordered by Aurangzeb to embrace Islam, and on his refusal, he was executed. The tenth and the last guru was Govind Singh. He made the Sikhs into a powerful military community, mainly to oppose the Delhi Emperor.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"it was his son, Shivaji, born in 1627, who became the glory of the Marathas and the terror of the Empire. When only a boy of nineteen he started on his predatory career and captured his first fort near Poona. He was a gallant captain, an ideal guerilla leader and adventurer, and he built up a band of brave and hardened mountaineers, who were devoted to him. With their help he captured many forts and gave Aurangzeb’s commanders a bad time. In 1665 he suddenly appeared at Surat, where there was the English factory, and sacked the city. He was induced to visit Aurangzeb’s Court at Agra, but he felt humiliated and insulted by not being treated as an independent prince. He was kept a prisoner, but escaped. Even then Aurangzeb tried to win him over by giving him the title of raja.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Having prepared the ground by forgery and treason, Clive defeated the Nawab at Plassey in 1757. This was a small battle, as battles go, and indeed it had been practically won by Clive by his intrigues even before the fighting began. But the little battle of Plassey had big results. It decided the fate of Bengal, and British dominion in India is often said to begin from Plassey.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"few years later, in 1764, the British won another battle, at Buxar, which resulted in the nominal Emperor at Delhi submitting to them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Haider Ali of Mysore was their bitter opponent. He was an able and fierce leader, and he repeatedly defeated the English forces. In 1769 he dictated terms of peace favourable to himself under the very walls of Madras. Ten years later he was again successful in a large measure, and after his death his son, Tippu Sultan, became a thorn in the side of the British. It took two more Mysore wars and many years to finally defeat Tippu.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"England satisfied her conscience by censuring or trying these men, but in her heart she admired them, and was willing enough to profit by their policy. Clive and Hastings may be censured, but they are the typical empire-builders, and so long as empires have to be forcibly imposed on subject people, and these people exploited, such men will come to the front and will gain admiration.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Clive may have been censured by the British Parliament, but they have put up a statue to him in front of the India Office in Whitehall in London, and inside, his spirit dwells and fashions British policy in India.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the East India Company—a trading company—was governing India. There was growing control by the British Parliament, but, in the main, India’s destinies were in the hands of a set of merchant adventurers. Government was largely trade, trade was largely plunder. The lines of distinction were thin. Enormous dividends of 100 per cent, and 150 per cent, and over 200 per cent, per year were paid by the Company to its shareholders.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A new dynasty usually produces some capable rulers to begin with and then tails off into incompetents.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Chinese language, you will remember, consists of characters, not words. Kang Hi had a lexicon or dictionary of the language prepared. This was a mighty work containing over 40,000 characters, with numerous phrases illustrating them. It is said to be unrivalled even today. Another of the productions which we owe to Kang Hi’s enthusiasm was a huge illustrated encyclopaedia, a wonderful work running into several hundred volumes. This was a complete library in itself; everything was dealt with, every subject considered. The book was printed from movable copper plates after Kang Hi’s death. The third important work I shall mention here was a concordance of the whole of Chinese literature—that is, a kind of dictionary in which words and passages are collected and compared. This also was an extraordinary piece of work, as it involved a close study of the whole of literature. Full quotations from poets, historians and essayists were given.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"James I, the King of England, who was father of Charles I who lost his head, was a great believer in the autocracy and the divine right of kings. He did not like Parliament or the upstart merchants of London and, in his anger, threatened the citizens of London with the removal of his Court to Oxford. The Lord Mayor of London was unmoved by this threat, and he said that he hoped “His Majesty would be graciously pleased to leave them the Thames”!\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The great hero of South American independence was Simon Bolivar, called El Libertador, the Liberator. The Republic of Bolivia in South America is named after him.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Monroe was President of the United States then, and he told the European Powers that if they interfered anywhere in America, North or South, they would have to fight the United States. This threat frightened the European Powers, and since then they have more or less kept away from South America. President Monroe’s threat to Europe has become famous as the “Monroe Doctrine”.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This is the name of Ahilya Bai, a ruler of Indore for thirty years from 1765 to 1795. She was a young widow of thirty when she came to the gaddi, and she succeeded remarkably well in administering her State.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the east, Burma had spread right up to Assam. So there was bound to be conflict with the ever-advancing British. There were three wars with Burma, each time the British annexing some territory. The first war in 1824-26 resulted in Assam coming under the British; in the second war, in 1852, South Burma was annexed. North Burma, with the capital at Ava near Mandalay, was completely cut off from the sea and left high and dry, at the mercy of the British. The end came in 1885, when there was a third Burma War, and the whole of the country was annexed by the British and joined on to the British Empire. But Burma was in theory a vassal of China; and indeed it used to send tribute regularly. It is curious to note that the British, when annexing Burma, agreed to continue this tribute to China.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kashmir was sold by the British to a certain Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu for about seventy-five lakhs of rupees. It was a bargain for Gulab Singh! The poor people of Kashmir of course did not count in the transaction.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But the fate of the Revolt was settled by the Indians themselves. The Sikhs and the Gurkhas supported the British. The Nizam in the south, and Scindia in the north, and many other Indian States, also lined up with the British. Even apart from these defections, the Revolt had the seeds of failure in it. It was fighting for a lost cause, the feudal order; it had no good leadership; it was badly organized, and there were mutual squabbles all the time.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is also well to remember that the cruelty of a mob is nothing compared to the cruelty of an organized government when it begins to behave like a mob. Even today, if you go to many of the villages in our province, you will find that the people have still got a vivid and ghastly memory of the horrors that befell them during the crushing of the Revolt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Revolt of 1857-58 was the last flicker of feudal India. It ended many things. It ended the line of the Great Moghal, for Bahadur Shah’s two sons and a grandson were shot down in cold blood, without any reason or provocation, by an English officer, Hodson, as he was carrying them away to Delhi. Thus, ignominiously, ended the line of Timur and Babar and Akbar.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even before the industrialization of England a famous English writer had pointed out the harmful effects of the East India Company’s rule in India. This man was Adam Smith, who is called the father of political economy. In a famous book of his called The Wealth of Nations, which was published as early as 1776, he said, referring to the East India Company: The government of an exclusive company of merchants is perhaps the worst of all governments for any country whatever . . . It is the interest of the East India Company considered as sovereigns that the European goods which are carried to their Indian dominions should be sold there as cheaply as possible; and that the Indian goods which are brought from there should be sold there as dear as possible. But the reverse of this is their interest as merchants. As sovereigns their interest is exactly the same with that of the country which they govern. As merchants their interest is directly opposite to that interest. I\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the first so-called legal title of the East India Company in Bengal was that of revenue-farmer on behalf of the Moghal Emperor. This was the grant of the Diwani to the Company in 1765.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Within twelve years of Plassey, within four years of the grant of the Diwani, the policy of the East India Company, added to want of rain, brought about a terrible famine in Bengal and Bihar, when one-third of the whole population perished. I have referred to this famine of 1769-70 in a previous letter to you, and told you that, in spite of it, the East India Company collected the full amount of revenue.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This settlement that Cornwallis made with the zamindars of Bengal and Bihar in 1793 is called the “Permanent Settlement”. The word “settlement” means the fixing of the amount of land revenue to be paid by each zamindar to the Government. For Bengal and Bihar this was fixed permanently. There was to be no change. Later on, as British rule spread in the north-west to Oudh and Agra, the British policy was changed. They had temporary settlements with zamindars, not permanent as in Bengal. Each temporary settlement was revised periodically, usually every thirty years, and the sum to be paid as land revenue was fixed afresh. Usually it was enhanced at every settlement.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Owing to the duty on machinery, which was not taken off till 1860, the cost of building a factory in India was four times that of building it in England, although labour was far cheaper in India.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"it is foolish to get angry with a country or with a people, with Britain or the British. They were as much the victims of circumstances as we were. Our study of history has shown us that life is often very cruel and callous. To get excited over it, or merely to blame people, is foolish and does not help. It is much more sensible to try to understand the causes of poverty and misery and exploitation, and then try to remove them. If we fail to do so, and fall back in the march of events, we are bound to suffer.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But one name towers above all others—that of Dadabhai Naoroji, who became the Grand Old Man of India and who first used the word Swaraj for India’s goal. One other name I shall tell you, for he is the sole survivor today of the old guard of the Congress, and you know him well. He is Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. For over fifty years he has laboured in India’s cause, and, worn down with years and anxiety, he labours still for the realization of the dream he dreamed in the days of his youth.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A high English officer in China, Sir Robert Hart, who was Inspector-General of the customs there at the time, went through the siege of the legations. He tells us that the foreigners, and especially the missionaries, were to blame for outraging Chinese feelings, and that the rebellion “was patriotic in its origin, and that it was justifiable in much that it aimed at cannot be questioned, and cannot be too much insisted on”.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The actual truth has never been written about any war, and this will be no exception.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1911 it changed its name to the Kuo-Min-Tang—the “People’s National Party”—and became the centre of the Chinese Revolution. Dr Sun, the inspirer of the movement, looked to the United States for his model. He wanted a republic, not a constitutional monarchy, as in England, and certainly no emperor-worship, as in Japan.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On February 12, 1912, an Edict of Abdication was issued, and thus disappeared the Manchu dynasty from the Chinese stage, after over two and a half centuries of memorable rule. According to a Chinese phrase: “They had come in with the roar of a tiger, to disappear like the tail of a snake.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"About 1848 another great agitation shook the country. This was called the Chartist Agitation, because it was proposed to present a monster petition to Parliament containing a “People’s Charter” demanding various reforms. After frightening the ruling classes greatly, the movement was suppressed.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This man was Otto von Bismarck, a junker—that is, a landowner in Prussia. Born in the year of Waterloo, he served for many years as a diplomatic envoy in various Courts. In 1862 he became Prime Minister of Prussia and immediately he began to make his influence felt. Within a week of his becoming Prime Minister he said in the course of a speech: “The great questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but by iron and blood.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The British ruling classes were so frightened by the French Revolution that they made laws—Combination Acts they were called— to prevent the poor workers from even meeting together to discuss their own grievance. “Law and order”, then in England as now in India, has always performed the very useful function of serving the ends and the pockets of the handful of those in authority.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Partly because of him, the British Parliament passed the first law to protect the workers against the greed and selfishness of the employers. This was the Factory Act of 1819. This Act laid down that little children of nine should not be made to work more than twelve hours a day. This provision itself will give you some idea of the terrible conditions to which the workers had to submit.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Owen’s idea was to have workers’ cooperative societies, and that workers should have a share in the factories.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If instead of this the State could own and control this, or at any rate the principal means of production, like the land and the chief industries, then there would be no danger of the workers being exploited.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even the British brand of socialism became the most moderate of all. Fabianism this was called, from an old Roman general who refused to give direct battle to the enemy, but gradually wore them out. In 1867 the British franchise was still further extended and some of the city workers got the vote. The trade unions were so well-behaved and prosperous that the labour vote was given to the British Liberal Party.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“That government is best which governs not at all; and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have”, said an American, Thoreau.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is easy enough to reconcile one’s conscience to any step that one desires to take.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"After the war was over, Lenin started a new Workers’ International in Moscow in 1919. This was a purely communist organization, and only declared communists could join it. This exists now, and is called the Third International.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"at present there are two International Workers’ organizations, briefly known as the Second and Third Internationals. Strangely enough, they both swear by Marxism, but each has its own interpretation, and yet they hate each other even more than they do their common enemy, capitalism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Socialism, I have told you, is of many kinds. There is general agreement, however, that it aims at the control by the State of the means of production—that is, land and mines and factories and the like—and the means of distribution, like railways, etc., and also banks and similar institutions. The idea is that individuals should not be allowed to exploit any of these methods or institutions, or the labour of others, to their own personal advantage.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"among Marxists also there are two main divisions in Europe—there are the Russian communists on the one hand, and the old social democrats of Germany, Austria and elsewhere on the other—and between the two there is no love lost.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The British Empire thus became a curious medley of two types of countries: the self-governing countries, which later became the free dominions, and the dependencies and protectorates. The former were more or less family members acknowledging the headship of the mother-country, the latter were definitely the servants and slaves of the establishment, looked down upon, ill treated and exploited. The self-governing dominions consisted of British people or other Europeans and their descendants, the dependencies were all non-British, non-European. This difference between the two parts of the British Empire has persisted till now.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When two such big parties run members for Parliament, it becomes very difficult for independent individuals or small groups to get elected. In spite of democracy and the vote, the poor voter has little say in the matter. He can either vote for the candidate of one of the parties or stay at home and not vote at all. And the members of the parties in Parliament have little independence left. They have to carry out the orders of their party chiefs and vote, and can do little else. For only in this way can they develop solidarity in the party and strength to defeat the rival party and thus gain office. This solidarity and uniformity is no doubt good in its own way, but it is very far from real democracy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"England allowed foodstuffs to come from abroad to feed her population, and allowed her agriculture to suffer. She concentrated on manufacturing articles industrially for sale abroad, and ignored the plight of her farmers. If she could get cheap food from abroad, why should she trouble to raise it herself?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"marched ahead in its ceaseless search for profits. Success and profits were the only gods that drew the worship of the people, for capitalism had nothing to do with religion or morality. It was the doctrine of cut-throat competition between individuals and nations,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This was the old French colony of Louisiana, which Napoleon sold to them, as he was quite unable to defend it from British naval attacks. A few years later, in 1822, a purchase, from Spain this time, brought Florida to the States, and in 1848 a successful war with Mexico brought several States in the south-west, including California.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The people who were in favour of this were called the “Abolitionists”, and their principal leader was William Lloyd Garrison. In 1831 Garrison brought out a paper called the Liberator to support his anti-slavery agitation. In the very first issue of this paper he made it clear that he was not going to compromise on this issue,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He made another effort to win over the South and prevent this break-up. He gave them all manner of assurances about allowing slavery to go on; he even said that he was prepared to make it (where it existed) a part of the constitution, which would give it permanence. In fact, he was prepared to go to almost any length for peace, but one thing he would not agree to, and that was the break-up of the Union.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He denied absolutely the right of any State to withdraw from the Union.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Lincoln’s attempts to avoid Civil War failed. The South had decided to break away, and eleven States did so, while some other border States also sympathized with them. The seceding States called themselves the “Confederate States” and elected their own President, Jefferson Davis.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in September 1862, he issued the Proclamation of Emancipation, in which it was declared that the slaves in all the States in rebellion against the government should be free on and after January 1st, 1863. The principal reason for issuing this proclamation was probably the desire to weaken the South in the war. It resulted in 4,000,000 slaves being freed, and it was no doubt hoped that these would create trouble in the Confederate States.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"I have told you already of the “Monroe Doctrine”, the rule which President Monroe of the United States laid down when some European Powers—the “Holy Alliance”— wanted to interfere in South America to preserve Spain’s empire. Monroe declared that the United States could not tolerate any armed intervention in the whole of America by any European Power. This declaration saved the young South American republics from Europe. It almost led to war with England once, but America has successfully stuck to this policy for more than 100 years now.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In American politics two parties grew up—the Republican and the Democratic. As in England, and even more so than in England, they represented the same rich classes, and there was little difference of principle between them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1846 the potato crop failed, and this resulted in a great famine. But despite the famine the landlords turned out their tenantry for non-payment of rent. Large numbers of Irishmen left their homes for America and other countries, and Ireland became almost a depopulated land. Many of her fields were tilled no longer and became pasture-lands.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Ottoman Empire connected three continents—Europe, Asia, Africa; it covered all the ancient trade routes between East and West. If the Turks had been so inclined and had possessed the necessary capacity for it, they could have taken advantage of this favourable position and become a great commercial nation. But they had no such inclination or capacity, and they went out of their way to discourage this trade, probably because they did not like to see others profiting by it. It was partly owing to this stopping of the old trade routes that the seafaring and commercial peoples of Europe felt compelled to search for other routes to the East, and this led to the discoveries of new routes by Columbus in the west and Diaz and Vasco da Gama in the east.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To give you an instance of how the European parts of the Ottoman dominions deteriorated: Athens, the famous city of old, was but a village of about 2000 inhabitants when Greece became free in 1829. (Now, hundred years later, Athens has a population of over 500,000.)\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The strength of the Ottoman Sultans for several hundred years consisted in the “Janissaries”, a corps of Turkish soldiers consisting of Christian slaves, who were carefully trained from boyhood upwards.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But remember that the word slave had not got quite the same meaning in Islamic countries in those days, as it has now. Slaves were often technically and legally slaves, but they rose to the highest offices. In India you will remember the Slave Kings of Delhi; Saladin of Egypt also was originally a slave. The point of view of the Turks seems to have been that a very thorough training should be given to the ruling class to make them as efficient as possible. They knew, as every teacher knows, that the best period to train a person is from early childhood upwards. It was perhaps not easy to take away the children of their Muslim subjects and cut them off completely from their parents or make them slaves. So they got hold of little Christian boys and made them join the Sultan’s slave household\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Turkey’s history for the last 200 years is one of warfare against the continually advancing Russians and against revolts by subject nationalities. Greece, Rumania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Bosnia, were all Balkan countries and parts of the Ottoman Empire. Greece, as we saw, broke away in 1829 with the help of England, France and Russia.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1774 Russia got the Crimea from Turkey, and thus reached the Black Sea.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Tsar of Russia, referring to Turkey, said to the British Ambassador in 1853: “We have on our hands a sick man—a very sick man . . . He may die suddenly upon our hands . . .” The phrase became a famous one, and Turkey was henceforth the “Sick Man of Europe”. But the sick man took a mighty long time in dying!\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There was a famous international conference in Berlin in 1878 to consider the fate of Turkey, and Bismarck was there and Disraeli, and many other leading politicians of Europe, and they threatened and intrigued against each other. England seemed to be on the verge of war with Russia when the latter gave in. As a result of the Treaty of Berlin, the Balkan countries Bulgaria, Serbia, Rumania and Montenegro gained their independence; Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina (which in theory remained under Turkish sovereignty); and Britain took the island of Cyprus, as a kind of commission from Turkey, for having sided with her to some extent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Montenegro, anxious to drive Turkey out of Europe and share the spoils, and seeing that the moment was favourable, allied themselves together in a Balkan League and attacked Turkey in October 1912. Turkey was exhausted and disorganized, and a contest for power was going on between the constitutionalists and the reactionaries. She collapsed completely before the Balkan League and had huge losses. Thus the first Balkan War ended in a few months, and Turkey was driven out of Europe almost completely, with only Constantinople remaining to her.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All the Ottoman Sultans, you will remember, were also Caliphs, or the religious heads of Islam. Abdul Hamid tried to exploit his position as such by attempting to build up a Pan-Islamic movement—that is, a movement in which Muslims of other countries could join, so that he could get their support. There was some talk of this Pan-Islamism for a few years in Europe and Asia, but it had no substantial foundation, and the Great War completely put an end to it. Pan-Islamism was opposed by nationalism in Turkey, and nationalism proved the greater force of the two.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Russia today is a Soviet country, and its government is run by representatives of the workers and peasants. In some ways it is the most advanced country in the world.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"freedom repressed has a way of adding compound interest to itself, and when it moves forward, its progress is likely to be in jumps, which upset the old apple-cart.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"other ways they were harassed and humiliated. Poland, which was industrially more advanced than Russia, had been made just a province of Russia, and the very name of Poland had practically disappeared. The Polish language was prohibited. If this was the treatment accorded to Poland, worse treatment was given to other minorities and races.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Jews were continually being subjected to pogroms— that is, massacres, and large numbers of them migrated to other countries.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To meet this menace the Tsar’s government adopted a method which was carried to extraordinary lengths. They sent agents-provocateurs to the ranks of the terrorists and revolutionaries, and these people actually provoked bomb outrages, and sometimes committed them themselves, so that they might implicate others.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1887, when he was seventeen, he had to face a terrible blow. His elder brother Alexander, to whom Lenin was greatly attached, was executed on the scaffold for taking part in a terroristic attempt on the Tsar’s life. In spite of the shock, Lenin said even then that freedom was not to be obtained by methods of terrorism; the way was through mass action only.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the victory lay with Lenin, and the Social Democratic Party split up into two, and two names, which have since become famous, came into existence—Bolsheviki and Mensheviki. Bolshevik is now a terrible word for some people; but all it means is the majority. Menshevik means minority. Lenin’s group in the party, after this split in 1903, being in the majority, was called Bolshevik—that is, the majority party. It is interesting to note that at that time Trotsky, then a young man of twenty-four, who was to be Lenin’s great colleague in the 1917 revolution, was on the side of the Mensheviks.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Strangely enough, these political strikes were rare in western Europe, in spite of its powerful trade unions and workers’ organizations. Or perhaps they were rare because the workers’ leaders had toned down on account of their vested interests.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The workers who had struck, especially in big centres like Petersburg and Moscow, created a new organization—the “Soviet”—in each such centre. This was at first just a committee to run the general strike. Trotsky became the leader of the Petersburg Soviet.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What the peasant revolts of the past had failed to do, what the terrorists with their bombs had not succeeded in doing, and what the moderate liberal constitutionalists with their cautious pleadings could not do, that the workers had done with their general strike. Tsardom, for the first time in its history, had to bow down to the common people. It turned out later to be an empty victory. But still the memory of it was a beacon of light for the workers.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"And yet—such stuff are revolutions made of!—of the Petersburg Bolshevik Committee of seven, it was discovered later that three were in the Tsarist secret service! The Bolsheviks had a small group in the Duma, and the leader of this was Malinowsky. He also was found to be a police agent! And Lenin trusted him.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"India was held down by a triple army of occupation—military, civil, and commercial. The British military forces, and the Indian mercenary army under British officers, were obvious enough as an alien army of occupation. But an even more powerful hold was that of the civil service, an irresponsible and highly centralized bureaucracy; and the third army, the commercial one, was supported by these two, and was the most dangerous of all, as most of the exploitation was done by this, or on its behalf, and its ways of exploiting the country were not so obvious as those of the other two.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A statement made by an English statesman, Lord Salisbury, who was Secretary of State for India, has often been quoted, and, as it is illuminating, I shall give it to you here. He said in 1875: As India must be bled, the lancet should be directed to the parts where the blood is congested, or at least is sufficient, not to those which are already feeble from want of it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1911 the first general Indian Factory Act was passed. Even this Act fixed a twelve-hour day for men, and six hours for children.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Each people was made to believe that their freedom was in danger and they must fight to defend it. The newspapers especially took a great part in creating this war atmosphere everywhere, which meant in effect bitter hatred of the people of the enemy countries.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Lenin and his group (most of the leaders were in exile outside Russia) opposed the war from the very beginning. They were not carried away by it like most of the socialists of other countries. They called it a capitalists’ war, with which the working class had no concern except insofar as they could profit by it to win their own freedom.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Russian generals were, even for military men, who are not usually supposed to be endowed with much intelligence, remarkably incompetent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Matters came to such a pass that a disgusting scoundrel, known as Gregory Rasputin, became the chief favourite of the Tsarina, and through her, of the Tsar. Rasputin (the word Rasputin means “dirty dog”) had been a poor peasant who had got into trouble over stealing horses. He decided to put on a garb of holiness and adopt the paying profession of an ascetic. As in India, this was an easy way of making money in Russia. He grew his hair long, and with his hair his fame also grew till it reached the imperial Court. The only son of the Tsar and Tsarina, called the Tsarevitch, was a bit of an invalid, and Rasputin somehow made the Tsarina believe that he would cure the boy. His fortune was made, and soon he dominated the Tsar and Tsarina, and the highest appointments were made at his instance. He lived a most depraved life, and took huge bribes, but for years he played this dominating part. Everybody was disgusted by this. Even the moderates and the aristocracy began to murmur, and there was talk of a palace revolution— that is, a forcible change of Tsars. Meanwhile Tsar Nicholas had made himself the commander-in-chief of his army and was making a mess of everything. A few days before the end of the year 1916 Rasputin was murdered by a member of the Tsar’s family.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When the Tsar heard of the workers’ strikes and disturbances in Petrograd, he ordered a declaration of martial law. This was formally declared by the general in command, but the declaration was not broadcast in the city or pasted up, as there was no one to do this job! The government machinery had gone to pieces. The Tsar, still blind to what was happening, tried to return to Petrograd. The railway workers stopped his train on the way. The Tsarina, who was then in a suburb of Petrograd, sent a telegram to the Tsar. It was returned from the telegraph office with a note in pencil: “Whereabouts of addressee unknown”!\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The three immediate slogans of the Bolsheviks became (1) democratic republic, (2) confiscation of the landed estates, and (3) an eight-hour day for the workers. Immediately, these slogans brought reality into the struggle for the peasantry and workers. It was not a vague and empty ideal for them; it meant life and hope.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Exactly a month after Lenin’s arrival another prominent exile came back to Petrograd. This was Trotsky, who had returned from New York after being detained on the way by the British. Trotsky was not one of the old Bolsheviks, nor was he now a Menshevik. But soon he lined up on the side of Lenin, and he took his place as the leading figure of the Petrograd Soviet. He was a great orator, a fine writer, and very much of an electric battery, full of energy, and he was of the greatest help to Lenin’s party.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"November 7 came, and Soviet soldiers went and occupied government buildings, especially the vital and strategic places like the telegraph office, telephone exchange, and the State Bank. There was no opposition. “The Provisional Government simply melted away,” said the official report sent to England by a British agent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Unimpressive to be the idol of the mob. A strange popular leader—a leader purely by virtue of intellect; colourless, humourless, uncompromising and detached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies—but with the power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analysing a concrete situation. And combining with shrewdness the greatest intellectual audacity.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Lenin’s advice was accepted in the end by the Soviet, and they signed the peace of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, much as they hated it. By this peace a huge slice of Russian territory on the west was annexed by Germany, but peace at any cost had to be accepted as, according to Lenin, “the army had voted for peace with its legs”.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"they were after world revolution; only thus, they thought, could they protect their own revolution. I have already told you that Soviet propaganda had great effect on the French and German armies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A greater danger to the Soviet regime came from the members of the various civil services, many of whom refused to work under the Bolsheviks or co-operate with them in any way. Lenin laid down the principle that “he that will not work, neither shall he eat”; no work, no food. All civil servants who did not co-operate were immediately dismissed. The bankers refused to open their safes; they were opened by dynamite. But the supreme example of Lenin’s contempt for the servants of the old order who refused to co-operate was seen when the Commander-in-Chief refused to obey orders. He was dismissed, and within five minutes a young Bolshevik lieutenant, Krylenko, was made the Commander-in-Chief!\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Lenin was opposed to the execution of the ex-Tsar on grounds of international policy, and of his family on humanitarian grounds. The deed having been done, however, the Central Government justified it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As the young French Republic had done a century and a quarter earlier, like a wild animal at bay, they turned on their enemies. There was to be no more tolerance, no mercy. The whole country was put under martial law, and early in September the Central Soviet Committee announced the Red Terror. “Death to all traitors, merciless war on the foreign invaders.” They would fight with their backs to the wall both the enemy within and the enemy without. It was the Soviet against the world and against its own reactionaries. A period of what is called “militant communism” also began, and the whole country was turned into a kind of besieged camp. Every effort was made to build up the Red Army, and Trotsky was put in charge of this.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Bolshevik Government sent a note to President Wilson pungently criticizing his Fourteen Points. In the course of this note they said: “You demand the independence of Poland, Serbia, Belgium, and freedom for the people of Austro-Hungary . . . But, strangely, we do not notice in your demands any mention of freedom for Ireland, Egypt, India, or even the Philippine Islands.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Single-handed, the Soviets fought a host of enemies. At one time the Red Army was attacked on seventeen different fronts. England, America, France, Japan, Italy, Serbia, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, the Baltic States, Poland, and a host of counter-revolutionary Russian generals were all opposing the Soviet, and the fighting extended from eastern Siberia to the Baltic and the Crimea.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Allies also blockaded Russia, and so effective was this that for the whole of 1919 Russia could neither buy nor sell anything abroad.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Freedom is a habit, and if we are deprived of it for long, we are apt to forget it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The farmers were not interested in producing much, because they said that the State would take away, under the militant communism then prevailing, all the extra stuff that they produced, so why should they take the trouble?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Lenin, with his genius for adapting fundamentals to existing conditions, immediately took action. He put an end to war-communism, and introduced a new policy called the New Economic Policy, or NEP for short (from the first letters). This gave greater freedom to the peasant to produce and sell his stuff, and it also permitted some private trading. It was a break-away to some extent from strict communistic principles, but Lenin justified it as a temporary measure.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is not many years since he died, and already Lenin has become a mighty tradition, not only in his native Russia, but in the world at large. As time passes he grows greater; he has become one of the chosen company of the world’s immortals. Petrograd has become Leningrad, and almost every house in Russia has a Lenin corner or a Lenin picture. But he lives, not in monuments or pictures, but in the mighty work he did, and in the hearts of hundreds of millions of workers today who find inspiration in his example, and the hope of a better day.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the past the Chinese people had attached little importance to political power as such. Their whole mighty civilization was based on culture, and it taught, in a way which has not been equalled elsewhere, the art of living. They were so full of this old culture of theirs that even when their political and economic structure fell down they clung to the old cultural ways.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the very size of huge countries like China and India creates difficulties. They are continental countries, and have something of the heaviness of a continent about them. When an elephant falls, he takes his time to get up; he cannot jump up like a cat or a dog.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"These “Twenty-one Demands” became famous. I shall not give them here. They meant the transfer of all manner of rights and privileges to Japan, especially in Manchuria, Mongolia, and in the province of Shantung. The result of agreeing to these demands would have been to convert China practically into a colony of Japan. The feeble Northern Chinese Government objected to these demands, but what could they do against the powerful Japanese army? And, then, this Chinese Government in the north was itself not a popular one with its own people. However, it did one thing which helped. The Japanese demands were published. There was a tremendous outcry immediately in China,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In Africa the German colonies were seized by the Allies as spoils of war, England getting the choicest morsels. By adding Tanganyika and other territories in East Africa, the British succeeded in realizing a long-cherished dream of a continuous strip of empire right across Africa, from Egypt in the north to the Cape in the south.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The League could only decide important matters unanimously. Thus if even one member-State voted against a proposition, it fell through. This meant that there was to be no coercion by a majority vote. It further meant that national sovereignties remained as independent and almost as irresponsible as before; the League did not become a kind of super-State over them. This provision weakened the League greatly and made it practically an advisory body.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"America, which was in a sense a parent of the League, refused to join it. The Americans disapproved of President Wilson’s activities and of European intrigues and complications, and decided to keep away.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Treaty should satisfy brigands, imperialists, and militarists. It is the death-blow to the hopes of those who expected the end of the war to bring peace. It is not a peace treaty, but a declaration of another war. It is the betrayal of democracy and of the fallen in the war. The Treaty exposes the true aims of the Allies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is a tendency to give them far more importance than they deserve, and every quarrel between a Hindu boy and a Muslim boy is considered a communal quarrel, and every petty riot is given great publicity. We must remember that India is a very big country, and in tens of thousands of towns and villages Hindus and Muslims live at peace with each other, and there is no communal trouble between them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Probably the Muslims of India have resisted this nationalizing process more than any other large group of Muslims in the world, and they are thus far more conservative and religious-minded than their co-religionists of the Islamic countries.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It was hardly possible to do anything on a big scale in the way of reform in social conditions if the richest people escaped taxation. During the long period of direct British rule, they had practically done nothing for primary education or the sanitation and improvement of village conditions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The unhappy Egyptian Parliament had appealed to the League of Nations against “the exploitation of a tragic incident for imperialist purposes”, but the League is blind and deaf to complaints against the great Powers.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Thereupon King Fuad had to give way and elections were held under the old system. Result: vast majority for Zaghlul’s party— 200 to 14! There could not have been a greater proof of Zaghlul’s hold on the nation and of what Egypt wanted. In spite of this the British Commissioner (who was Lord Lloyd, an ex-Indian governor) said he objected to Zaghlul becoming Prime Minister and another person was, therefore, appointed. What business the English had to interfere in the matter it is a little difficult to understand. The new Government was, however, largely controlled by Zaghlul’s party and, in spite of all attempts at moderation, they often came into conflict with Lloyd, who was a most imperious and domineering individual, and who often threatened them with British warships.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There was a coup d’état, and by a decree the King suspended Parliament and altered the constitution. The articles in the constitution dealing with the freedom of the Press and other liberties were abolished and a dictatorship was proclaimed. There were rejoicings in the English Press\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The immediate cause, however, was a dispute about the “Wailing Wall”, as it is called. This is part of the wall which surrounded Herod’s temple in old times, and is thus sacred to the Jews, who look upon it as a monument of the days when they were a great people. Subsequently a mosque was built there, and this wall was made part of the structure. The Jews say their prayers near this wall and, especially, recite their lamentations in a loud voice—hence the name the “Wailing Wall”. The Muslims object to this practice near a part of one of their most famous mosques.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"it is a fact that the Jewish immigrants there have improved the country, introduced industries, and raised standards of living. But we must remember that Palestine is essentially an Arab country, and must remain so, and the Arabs must not be crushed and suppressed in their own homelands. The two peoples could well co-operate together in a free Palestine, without encroaching on each other’s legitimate interests, and help in building up a progressive country.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In Hungary a revolution broke out as early as October 3, 1918, five weeks before the war ended. In November a republic was proclaimed. Four months later, in March 1919, a second revolution took place. This was a Soviet revolution under the leadership of a communist, Bela Kun, who had been associated with Lenin previously. A Soviet government was established, and it was in power for some months. Thereupon the conservative and reactionary elements in the country invited a Rumanian army to come to their help. The Rumanians came most willingly, helped to crush Bela Kun’s government, and then settled down to loot the country. They only left when the Allied Powers threatened to take action against them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The conservatives were opposed to any recognition of the Soviets, and in the next British general election, which came within a year of the last one, Russia figured greatly. This was due to the fact that a certain letter, known as the Zinoviev letter, was made a trump card by the conservatives in the election. In this letter communists in England were urged to work secretly for revolution. Zinoviev was a leading Bolshevik in the Soviet Government; he denied absolutely having written the letter and said that it must be a forgery. But still the conservatives exploited the letter fully and, partly with its help, managed to win the election. A Conservative Government was now formed with Stanley Baldwin as the Prime Minister. This government was repeatedly asked to investigate the truth or falsity of the “Zinoviev letter”, but it refused to do so. Subsequent disclosures in Berlin showed that it was a forgery made by a “white” Russian—that is, an anti-Bolshevik émigré Russian. The forgery, however, had done its work in England and put an end to one government and brought in another. By such trivial incidents are international affairs influenced!\"\n\n---------\n\n\"I have not included the Soviet Union in the above list of dictatorships, because the dictatorship there, although as ruthless as any other, is of a different type. It is not the dictatorship of an individual or a small group, but of a well-organized political party basing itself especially on the workers. They call it the “dictatorship of the proletariat”. Thus we have three kinds of dictatorships—the communist type, the fascist, and the military.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Patriotism among wealthy people does not apparently stand the strain of a risk to money or vested interest.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When the war began, the American Government owed Europe five thousand million dollars; when the war ended Europe owed America ten thousand million dollars.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To understand a person who lived long ago, you will have to understand his environment, the conditions under which he lived, the ideas that filled his mind.

He argued that we could classify ETCs in terms of the technology they possessed, and he devised a 3-point scale for measuring the potency of that technology. A Kardashev type 1 civilization, or KI civilization, would be comparable to our own: it could employ the energy resources of a planet. A KII civilization would be far beyond our own: it could employ the energy resources of a star. A KIII civilization could employ the energy resources of an entire galaxy. According to Gillett, then, most ETCs in the Galaxy would be of a KII or KIII type.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The simplest resolution of the Fermi paradox is that “they”—in other words, intelligent representatives from extraterrestrial civilizations—are already here (or, if they aren’t here now, they were at least here some time in the past). Of the three classes of solution to the paradox, this one is by far the most popular amongst the general public.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For example, some radionuclides possess half lives measured in millions of years, so if extraterrestrial visitors dumped nuclear waste on the Cretaceous landscape it might leave a trace that we could detect today.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Several types of orbit are suitable for parking an observational probe, but perhaps the best known are the Lagrangian points. If a small mass is near two much larger orbiting masses, then there are five points at which the small mass can orbit at a fixed distance from the larger masses. These five Lagrangian points mark the positions where the gravitational pull of the two larger masses exactly balances the centripetal force required to rotate with them. Three of the Lagrangian points —L1, L2 and L3—are unstable: nudge the small mass and it will move away from the L point. But L4 and L5 are stable: nudge the small mass and it will return to the L point.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The space agencies NASA and ESA already make heavy use of parking facilities offered by the Sun–Earth Lagrangian points. If NASA and ESA find it convenient to use those points then perhaps ETCs would do so too. Perhaps we might find probes at Lagrangian points in the Earth–Moon system?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"at least one dedicated search has been made. Furthermore, astronomers have already studied the L4 and L5 points of the Earth–Moon system, since the points are interesting from a general astronomical viewpoint. In neither the dedicated search nor the general scans was any evidence of probes found.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The romantic notion of an advanced Martian civilization capable of building canals and launching satellites didn’t survive the 1960s. It was laid to rest when the early Mariner spacecraft flew by at close range, returning photographs that showed none of the canals seen by Lowell. The Viking landers of 1976 and the Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor missions of 1997 also failed to find canals. Similarly, the flyby missions saw nothing at all artificial about Phobos.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If you search through a large collection of random data long enough and hard enough, conveniently ignoring arrangements of the data that are of no interest and not defining beforehand what you are looking for, then eventually you will find something remarkable.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There are 50 billion billion billion cubic miles of space within a sphere that encloses the orbit of Pluto; and the Solar System extends to the Oort Cloud of comets, almost a light year from the Sun. The chances of finding a small alien artifact by accident are essentially zero. Only if an artifact draws attention to itself—by signaling us, perhaps, or by being in a visible location—will we detect it. We therefore can’t rule out the possibility that observational probes were once in the Solar System nor, indeed, that they are still here. Some would argue that until we can rule out that possibility, there is no Fermi paradox.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What we can say with confidence, however, is that no evidence for alien artifacts has yet been uncovered.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The idea that life originated elsewhere and was somehow transported to Earth is an old one. The notion of panspermia —literally “seeds everywhere”—probably dates back to Anaxagoras.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"More recently, researchers have investigated the ability of some extremophiles—microorganisms that can thrive in extremely harsh terrestrial environments—to withstand the conditions found in space. Experiments have shown that extremophilic microorganisms, when protected by microsized carbonaceous grains, can survive hours of intense radiation from a synchrotron source—the equivalent of an accumulated radiation dose from millions of years of solar radiation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Ball proposed that ETCs are ubiquitous; many technological civilizations will stagnate or face destruction (from within or without) but some will develop their level of technology over time. Arguing in analogy with terrestrial civilizations, he reasoned that we need only consider the most technologically advanced civilizations. Those ETCs will, in some sense, be in control of the universe because the less advanced will be destroyed, tamed or assimilated. The important question becomes: how will highly developed ETCs choose to exert their power? Arguing in analogy with how mankind exerts its power over the natural world, wherein we set aside wilderness areas, wildlife sanctuaries and zoos so that other species can develop naturally, Ball speculated that Earth is in a wilderness area set aside for us by ETCs. The reason there seems to be no interaction between them and us is that they don’t want to be found—and they have the technological ability to ensure we don’t find them. The zoo scenario involved the idea that advanced ETCs are simply observing us.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The zoo scenario has been criticized on several grounds. A major drawback to my mind is that it leads us nowhere: it’s not a testable hypothesis.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Stephen Baxter has proposed an interesting variant on the zoo scenario. He calls it the planetarium hypothesis. The speculation is far wilder than Ball’s idea, but it merits the term “hypothesis” rather than “scenario” because it offers testable predictions. Is it possible, Baxter asks, that the world we live in is a simulation—a virtual-reality “planetarium” engineered to present us with the illusion that the universe is devoid of intelligent life?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The planetarium hypothesis taken to extreme is similar to solipsism. The true solipsist believes that everything he experiences—people, events, objects—is part of the content of his consciousness, rather than an external reality in which we all share. It’s not just that his is the only mind that exists. (The sole survivor of some planet-wide catastrophe might be correct if he believed his was the only mind, and yet he wouldn’t necessarily be a solipsist.) Rather, the true solipsist in principle can attach no meaning to the idea that other minds experience thoughts and emotions. It’s an egocentric view of the universe. The most extreme planetarium, therefore, would have an ETC generate an artificial universe directly into my consciousness. The universe appears to me to be empty because an ETC, for some reason, wants to fool me into so thinking.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Occam’s razor gives us a reason for rejecting all these planetaria. Suppose you throw a ball and watch its parabolic path: you’ll conclude the ball is an autonomous object obeying Newton’s law of gravity. The alternative—that some system (whether an individual consciousness or a sophisticated virtual-reality generator) contains laws that simulate the properties of the ball and its motion under gravity—is a more complex explanation of the same phenomenon. Both explanations fit the observations. But Occam’s razor tells us to use the simplest explanation, which in this case is that the ball is “real”. It has an autonomous existence. We can make the same argument regarding our observations of the universe.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Baxter points out that a fundamental requirement of a planetarium is that scientific experiments should always yield consistent results.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The planetarium hypothesis defies both Occam’s razor and our basic intuition about how the universe works.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the decades to come, as we explore more of the universe and test the fabric of reality at ever-larger distance scales, we will either find an inconsistency in the simulation or be forced to accept that the universe is “real”.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"since ETCs are likely to be far in advance of us, they’ll be almost omniscient, omnipotent beings. We’d think of them as gods. Many SETI scientists would disagree: an ETC’s technology might indeed be so far advanced that it is, to use Clarke’s phrase, indistinguishable from magic, but surely we know enough to consider these beings as master engineers. At worst, we’d look on them as thaumaturgists. We know enough not to think of them as gods.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the laws of physics don’t forbid interstellar travel, but they don’t make it easy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"First assumption: a civilization can appear at any point in unoccupied space with some small probability. Second, and crucially, all civilizations have the same natural lifetime, , after which they start to die. (The authors believe the universal cause of the death of civilizations would be the loss of “basic functions—knowledge functions”. In other words, having learned all it can about itself and its environment a civilization has no desire to continue. It withers, dies.) Third: if one civilization makes contact with another then the lifetime of both increases by a time : the contact generates new things to learn, new conversations to be had, a spur to further development.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the bonus stimulated model a civilization is represented by a square of cells, with the central square being the birthplace of the civilization. The model can be defined as a cellular automaton by casting the assumptions in the form of transition rules. The first rule is that a new civilization can be born in any empty cell; the probability of birth is and the civilization begins as a single cell. The second rule is that, with each tick of the clock, the civilization changes size by one layer of cells on each side: if the civilization is younger than then it increases in size; if the civilization is older than then it decreases in size; and when the size becomes zero, in other words when there are no more cells, then the civilization is dead. Third rule: if a growing civilization meets another civilization—which in this model means that a cell has to belong to both civilizations—then the lifetime of both civilizations is increased by the bonus time ; if there are several civilizations in a cluster then they all get the bonus time. The subsequent development of each civilization is as in the second rule.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Models of galactic colonization based on diffusion (such as the Newman–Sagan proposal), percolation (the Landis proposal) or cellular automata (Bezsudnov and Snarski) make statements about the migratory behavior of species that are assumed to hold true over timescales measured in hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. Colin McInnes developed a model of migration that only needs to hold true over a period of a few millennia in order to account for the lack of extraterrestrial visitors here on Earth. It’s a rather bleak resolution of the Fermi paradox; unfortunately, when one considers the behavior of the human species, it seems rather plausible.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"An automaton can reproduce itself as follows. The program first tells the constructor to make a copy of the program’s instructions and place the copy in a holder. It then tells the constructor to make a copy of itself with a clear memory bank. Finally, it tells the constructor to move the copy of the program from the holder to the memory bank. The result is a reproduction of the original device. The reproduction can function in the same environment as the original and is itself capable of self-reproduction.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In a lecture first given in 1948, he discussed the relevance of self-reproducing automata to the question of life. He argued that a living cell, when it reproduces, must follow the same basic operations as a self-reproducing automaton. Within living cells, there must be a constructor and there must be a program. He was right. We now know that nucleic acids play the role of the program and proteins play the role of the constructor. All of us are self-reproducing automata.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A spaceship containing a sufficient number of human couples, the appropriate life support systems, stored knowledge in the form of large databases and a sophisticated onboard factory would constitute a Bracewell–von Neumann probe.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since colonization of the Galaxy by probe seems straightforward, at least on paper, some authors argue that there’s an inevitable motivation for an ETC to engage in colonization: if we don’t do it, some other species will. Stake your claim early, in other words. (This sort of argument might have appealed to von Neumann, who was a strong proponent of the nuclear first strike. In an interview with a Time magazine reporter, von Neumann said: “If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say, why not today? If you say five o’clock, I say at one o‘clock.” We must be grateful that, in the 1950s and 1960s, wiser counsel than von Neumann’s prevailed.)\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Consider two strings, each containing a trillion characters. The first string starts “101010…” and continues in that way until the trillionth character is reached; the second string starts “x9Y$m&…” and carries on in a seemingly randomly pattern. The Kolmogorov complexity of strings such as these is defined as the minimum length in bits of a binary-coded program that describes the string. The Kolmogorov complexity of the first string is small because one requires only a short program to describe it: in words, the program could be something along the lines of “Print alternating sequence of 1s and 0s, starting with 1 and ending after the trillionth digit”. The Kolmogorov complexity of the second string is large because there’s no obvious way of compressing the information it contains; any program describing the string would likely be as long as the string itself. Gurzadyan argued that the Kolmogorov complexity of the human genome—indeed, of the totality of terrestrial life—is relatively low. There’s a vast amount of genetic information contained in the millions of species on Earth, but the program that describes that information might be much smaller.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kepler “objects of interest” (KOI) are those stars that are known to possess planets and that are judged to be most amenable to the presence of Earth-like life. Targeted searches of KOI have already taken place, and more will surely follow.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Many mathematicians, perhaps most of them, subscribe at least tacitly to Platonism. The Platonic philosophy holds that mathematics and mathematical laws exist in some sort of ideal form outside the realm of space and time. The work of a pure mathematician is therefore akin to that of a gold prospector; a mathematician searches for nuggets of pre-existing absolute mathematical truth. Mathematics is discovered, not invented.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"since the ability to make rapid judgments based upon the perceived numbers of objects is so clearly useful, we might expect animals to possess some sort of “number sense”. There is indeed evidence that rats and raccoons, chickens and chimpanzees can make rudimentary numerical judgments.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Could a solution to the Fermi paradox be that other civilizations develop other systems of mathematics—systems that are useful for the local conditions in which they find themselves but inapplicable for use in building interstellar communication or propulsion devices?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As a resolution to the paradox this suffers from the same difficulty as several others: even if it applies to some civilizations (and many would deny even that possibility), it surely can’t apply to all civilizations.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But even if we detect a message, could we decode the contents? Consider the Voynich Manuscript. In 1912, Wilfred Voynich, a collector, claimed to have bought a 234-page book from the Jesuit College at the Villa Mondragone, Frascati, in Italy. It presently resides in the Rare Book Room at the Library of Yale University, where its less romantic catalog name is MS 408. The book is about the size of a modern-day paperback, and is bound in a soft, ivory-colored vellum. Many Voynich scholars believe the book was written some time between the 13 century and 1608; radiocarbon dating suggests that the vellum was made from animal that was alive in the early 15 century. And this is pretty much everything we know about the manuscript: it was written in a language or code that no one has yet deciphered.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Whatever information the Voynich Manuscript contains, we know it was written by a human being in the not too distant past. So the author had the same sensory inputs as the rest of us; a cultural background that is recognizable, if not identical to our own; human emotions that drove him (or her) in exactly the same way they drive us. And yet he (or she) wrote a book we can’t decipher. If such a situation can occur with a member of our own species, what chance do we have of understanding a message from an ETC?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One problem with signal recognition is the following: physicists have shown that if a message is sent electromagnetically and has been encoded for optimal efficiency, then an observer who is ignorant of the coding scheme will find the message indistinguishable from blackbody radiation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Well, in 2004 Christopher Rose (a professor of electrical engineering at Rutgers University) and Gregory Wright (an astrophysicist) took a communications-theory approach to the question of interstellar communication. In particular, they dropped the requirement that information had to be sent at the fastest possible speed and then investigated how much energy would be required to send a message. Their result was startlingly clear but counter-intuitive (at least, it was counter-intuitive to me): from an energy perspective it makes much more sense to write down a message on some material and hurl it into space than it does to broadcast the message. Sending a physical message has the added advantage that if the message is intercepted and decoded then the entirety of the information gets through, without the need for repetition: you can guarantee the recipient has a chance of watching the whole of Chinatown rather than risk them seeing just the final few seconds.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"just before it went live in 2008 there were lawsuits filed in various courts, protests at the European Commission and death threats aimed at members of the LHC team. All the worries expressed about previous collider experiments were trotted out before the LHC began operations, along with another possibility: that particle collisions might generate monopoles—hypothetical particles that are, in essence, isolated magnetic poles. Physicists at CERN patiently answered the worries, but to my mind that was unnecessary. As Rees and Hut remarked when discussing the possibility that the Tevatron might collapse the vacuum, the LHC isn’t doing anything that Nature isn’t already doing daily and on a much larger scale. High-energy particles collide with nuclei in Earth’s atmosphere all the time. Fortunately the lawsuits and the fearmongering got nowhere, and in 2012 the LHC made one of the great achievements of 21st century science when it discovered the Higgs boson.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 2003, for example, the planetary scientist David Stevenson published a (tongue-in-cheek) proposal to investigate Earth’s core. The idea was to use nuclear weapons to open a crack in Earth’s crust and then fill the crack with molten iron containing a probe. The iron would fall under gravity and eventually reach Earth’s core, carrying the probe with it. In case anyone was dreaming of actually doing this, Ćirković and Cathcart pointed out that it would be a rather dangerous activity: large deposits of carbon dioxide could be released, causing a global warming effect much greater than mankind is producing. Earth might end up like Venus.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One element of any future nanotechnology is likely to be the nanorobot—nanobot, for short. We should welcome the coming of the nanobots because they have the potential to improve health care: they’ll diagnose medical problems at an early stage, monitor the body’s processes and target the delivery of drugs.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As Asimov was fond of pointing out, when man invented the sword he also invented the hand guard so that one’s fingers didn’t slither down the blade when one thrust at an opponent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Human Genome Project, which was founded formally in 1990, made a rough draft of the genome available in 2000 at a cost of a couple of billion pounds; when I published the first edition of this book, the cost of sequencing a human-sized genome had fallen to about sixty million pounds; the equivalent cost today is about four thousand pounds and soon cost simply won’t be an issue. Progress in genomic sequencing is following a path that makes Moore’s law seem tardy. It seems certain that within a few decades the billions of individuals here on Earth will have the capacity, if they so wish, to create artificial life.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"any population of several billion will contain individuals who are insane, hateful or vengeful: we have plenty of such people among us right now. The difference is that in a few years those people will be able to create pathogens that target those possessing the “wrong” number of X chromosomes, “too high” a production of melanin, or otherwise “undesirable” genetic traits. The equal-opportunities misanthrope could unleash an engineered bioweapon to kill us all. So Cooper offers this as a possible resolution of the paradox: any spacefaring civilization will possess a knowledge of how to destroy its own type of life, and it’s likely that one individual from the billions that make up the civilization will—for whatever reason—apply that knowledge.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What’s required is that Goldilocks “just right” object, a planet on which water is free to flow and work its magic. Earth is clearly a Goldilocks planet in this respect, but it’s not immediately obvious why Earth possesses the surface temperature it does. Clearly, Earth receives energy from the Sun and that warms our planet—but then why isn’t the Moon at the same temperature as Earth? After all, both Earth and Moon are the same distance from the Sun.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We have the atmosphere to thank for Earth’s temperate nature. Earth receives energy from the Sun at a variety of electromagnetic wavelengths—ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared. Almost all of this energy passes straight through the atmosphere and about half of it is absorbed at Earth’s surface, which subsequently becomes warm. Any warm surface will radiate simply because it’s warm, and the peak wavelength of the radiation depends upon the surface’s temperature. In the case of Earth, most of the thermal radiation it emits is in the far infrared region. Here’s the wonderful thing: the chemical make-up of Earth’s atmosphere is such that it’s almost transparent to the incoming short-wavelength ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared radiation but it’s almost opaque to the outgoing longer-wavelength far-infrared radiation. The radiation emitted by Earth’s surface is absorbed by the atmosphere, which then re-radiates it—and the radiation that’s emitted downwards is absorbed by Earth’s surface. Our atmosphere thus keeps us warm. Not only that, the atmosphere has a moderating effect; winds carry heat from the equator to the poles and from the day side of the planet to the night side. Without an atmosphere, there would surely be no life on Earth.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"First, fossil fuels constitute a finite resource. An inexorable increase in energy demand will eventually exhaust fuel reserves. If our access to fossil fuels were to end abruptly, right now, the consequences would be unthinkable. Our civilization would collapse. One suggested resolution of the Fermi paradox, then, is that the inevitable depletion of fossil fuels means that civilizations never make it into deep space. They collapse before they can colonize a world that contains more energy resources.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It’s already safer, cheaper and more practical to explore Mars using telepresence than it is to attempt to send manned craft. We can even do science at a distance. For example, if a rover found alien microbial life hiding under the sands of Mars then we wouldn’t need to send astronauts to investigate: genome sequencers inside the rover could transmit genetic information back to Earth and we could reconstruct the life form in labs using biological printers.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Lampton’s take on the Fermi paradox, therefore, is that all technologically based societies eventually make a transition: pre-transition societies are motivated by colonization, conquest and trade; post-transition societies are driven by information. A post-transition society doesn’t have to “be there” if it has a complete but remote knowledge of “there”. When an individual from a posttransition society really wants to visit “there”, it need simply construct a local simulation. If such a societal transition occurs on a short timescale compared to the colonization timescale—and if we extrapolate current trends here on Earth that would appear to be likely—then the paradox disappears.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Intelligence Principle implies that given enough time—and ETCs will have had enough time—biologically based intelligence will create artificial intelligence. The products of biological evolution will be replaced by, or will merge with, their machine progeny. Stapledonian thinking suggests that we might live in a postbiological universe.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Cambridge cosmologist John Barrow has introduced a scale of inward manipulation, which one can argue would be just as applicable to ETCs as the Kardashev energy scale. A civilization at the BI level of advancement can manipulate objects at its own size, or about 1 m (assuming that intelligent beings exist, as we do, at this size). A BII civilization can work with objects at the  m scale, which would allow it to manipulate genes. A BIII civilization can work with objects at the  m scale, which would allow it to manipulate molecules. Barrow argues that human civilization is now at the BIV level, since various technological advances are allowing us to manipulate individual atoms at the  m scale.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"there are 35 orders of magnitude between the human scale of 1 m and the smallest possible scale defined by quantum physics—the Planck scale; there are “only” 26 orders of magnitude between the human scale and the size of the observable universe.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Perhaps, then, as ETCs advance in sophistication they choose to investigate the microworld instead of, or at least in addition to, the macroworld. A better classification of ETCs might be their ability to manipulate smaller and smaller length scales. On the Barrow scale a BV civilization could manipulate atomic nuclei (and thus work at the  m distance range); a BVI civilization could manipulate elementary particles ( m); and a B civilization could manipulate the structure of spacetime itself ( m).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Vidal argues that black holes are “attractors for intelligence”: KII–B civilizations will be drawn to using these extreme objects. With our current level of understanding it’s impossible to state what such an advanced civilization would choose to do with their black holes, but it’s interesting to speculate. Advanced civilizations might, for example, use black holes to store or extract energy—various mechanisms have been proposed for extracting energy from black holes, and they often have excellent efficiency. Or they might use them for science: a black hole gravitational lens could form the basis of a hugely powerful telescope.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The argument simply requires there to be some number of critical yet unlikely steps on the road to intelligence, with each step only possible after earlier earlier steps in the sequence have taken place. The eminent evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr once listed over a dozen such steps; other scientists have suggested the number might be even greater, particularly if certain physical and astronomical coincidences are added to the list. The status of these various steps can, of course, be contested. Some of the evolutionary steps we call “difficult” might not be hurdles at all. We regard a particular evolutionary step as being difficult if it occurred only once in Earth’s history, but some steps probably could be taken only once—the competition they stimulated would have made a second occurrence redundant. On the other hand, some steps probably were genuinely improbable. For example, if a particular critical step required several otherwise worthless mutations to take place at the same time, then it would make sense to regard the step as a fluke.\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/NqYC6kBewa4SuClAF0zXl.html","relUrl":"notes/NqYC6kBewa4SuClAF0zXl.html"},{"doc":"Debt - The First 5000 Years","title":"Debt - The First 5000 Years","hpath":"kindle_highlights.debt_the_first_5000_years","content":"\n\"WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE between a mere obligation, a sense that one ought to behave in a certain way, or even that one owes something to someone, and a debt, properly speaking?

Economists simply ignored this information.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"to this day, no one has been able to locate a part of the world where the ordinary mode of economic transaction between neighbors takes the form of “I’ll give you twenty chickens for that cow.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The definitive anthropological work on barter, by Caroline Humphrey, of Cambridge, could not be more definitive in its conclusions: “No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money;\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Barter, then, for all the festive elements, was carried out between people who might otherwise be enemies and hovered about an inch away from outright warfare—and, if the ethnographer is to be believed—if one side later decided they had been taken advantage of, it could very easily lead to actual wars.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What all such cases of trade through barter have in common is that they are meetings with strangers who will, likely as not, never meet again, and with whom one certainly will not enter into any ongoing relations. This is why a direct one-on-one exchange is appropriate: each side makes their trade and walks away.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Recall here the language of the economics textbooks: “Imagine a society without money.” “Imagine a barter economy.” One thing these examples make abundantly clear is just how limited the imaginative powers of most economists turn out to be.21\"\n\n---------\n\n\"it begins to be clear why there are no societies based on barter. Such a society could only be one in which everybody was an inch away from everybody else’s throat; but nonetheless hovering there, poised to strike but never actually striking, forever.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It would have been easy enough to standardize the ingots, stamp them, create some authoritative system to guarantee their purity. The technology existed. Yet no one saw any particular need to do so. One reason was that while debts were calculated in silver, they did not have to be paid in silver—in fact, they could be paid in more or less anything one had around. Peasants who owed money to the Temple or Palace, or to some Temple or Palace official, seem to have settled their debts mostly in barley, which is why fixing the ratio of silver to barley was so important. But it was perfectly acceptable to show up with goats, or furniture, or lapis lazuli. Temples and Palaces were huge industrial operations—they could find a use for almost anything.34\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One of the popular fallacies in connection with commerce is that in modern days a money-saving device has been introduced called credit and that, before this device was known, all purchases were paid for in cash, in other words in coins. A careful investigation shows that the precise reverse is true. In olden days coins played a far smaller part in commerce than they do today. Indeed so small was the quantity of coins, that they did not even suffice for the needs of the [Medieval English] Royal household and estates which regularly used tokens of various kinds for the purpose of making small payments. So unimportant indeed was the coinage that sometimes Kings did not hesitate to call it all in for reminting and reissue and still commerce went on just the same.36\"\n\n---------\n\n\"our standard account of monetary history is precisely backwards. We did not begin with barter, discover money, and then eventually develop credit systems. It happened precisely the other way around. What we now call virtual money came first. Coins came much later, and their use spread only unevenly, never completely replacing credit systems. Barter, in turn, appears to be largely a kind of accidental byproduct of the use of coinage or paper money: historically, it has mainly been what people who are used to cash transactions do when for one reason or another they have no access to currency.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Smith was trying to make a similar, Newtonian argument.2 God—or Divine Providence, as he put it—had arranged matters in such a way that our pursuit of self-interest would nonetheless, given an unfettered market, be guided “as if by an invisible hand” to promote the general welfare. Smith’s famous invisible hand was, as he says in his Theory of Moral Sentiments, the agent of Divine Providence. It was literally the hand of God.3\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Money is unimportant. Economies—“real economies”—are really vast barter systems. The problem is that history shows that without money, such vast barter systems do not occur. Even when economies “revert to barter,” as Europe was said to do in the Middle Ages, they don’t actually abandon the use of money. They just abandon the use of cash. In the Middle Ages, for instance, everyone continued to assess the value of tools and livestock in the old Roman currency, even if the coins themselves had ceased to circulate.6\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Credit Theorists insisted that money is not a commodity but an accounting tool. In other words, it is not a “thing” at all. You can no more touch a dollar or a deutschmark than you can touch an hour or a cubic centimeter. Units of currency are merely abstract units of measurement, and as the credit theorists correctly noted, historically, such abstract systems of accounting emerged long before the use of any particular token of exchange.8\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If money is a just a yardstick, what then does it measure? The answer was simple: debt. A coin is, effectively, an IOU.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What credit theorists like Mitchell-Innes were arguing is that even if Henry gave Joshua a gold coin instead of a piece of paper, the situation would be essentially the same. A gold coin is a promise to pay something else of equivalent value to a gold coin. After all, a gold coin is not actually useful in itself. One only accepts it because one assumes other people will. In this sense, the value of a unit of currency is not the measure of the value of an object, but the measure of one’s trust in other human beings.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"money is simply a unit of measure, it makes sense that emperors and kings should concern themselves with such matters. Emperors and kings are almost always concerned to established uniform systems of weights and measures throughout their kingdoms.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"According to Knapp, whether or not the actual, physical money stuff in circulation corresponds to this “imaginary money” is not particularly important. It makes no real difference whether it’s pure silver, debased silver, leather tokens, or dried cod—provided the state is willing to accept it in payment of taxes. Because whatever the state was willing to accept, for that reason, became currency.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One of the most important forms of currency in England in Henry’s time were notched “tally sticks” used to record debts. Tally sticks were quite explicitly IOUs: both parties to a transaction would take a hazelwood twig, notch it to indicate the amount owed, and then split it in half. The creditor would keep one half, called “the stock” (hence the origin of the term “stock holder”) and the debtor kept the other, called “the stub” (hence the origin of the term “ticket stub.”) Tax assessors used such twigs to calculate amounts owed by local sheriffs. Often, though, rather than wait for the taxes to come due, Henry’s exchequer would often sell the tallies at a discount, and they would circulate, as tokens of debt owed to the government, to anyone willing to trade for them.14\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In fact this is precisely the logic on which the Bank of England—the first successful modern central bank—was originally founded. In 1694, a consortium of English bankers made a loan of £1,200,000 to the king. In return they received a royal monopoly on the issuance of banknotes. What this meant in practice was they had the right to advance IOUs for a portion of the money the king now owed them to any inhabitant of the kingdom willing to borrow from them, or willing to deposit their own money in the bank—in effect, to circulate or “monetize” the newly created royal debt. This was a great deal for the bankers (they got to charge the king 8 percent annual interest for the original loan and simultaneously charge interest on the same money to the clients who borrowed it), but it only worked as long as the original loan remained outstanding. To this day, this loan has never been paid back. It cannot be. If it ever were, the entire monetary system of Great Britain would cease to exist.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On the other hand, if one simply hands out coins to the soldiers and then demands that every family in the kingdom was obliged to pay one of those coins back to you, one would, in one blow, turn one’s entire national economy into a vast machine for the provisioning of soldiers, since now every family, in order to get their hands on the coins, must find some way to contribute to the general effort to provide soldiers with things they want. Markets are brought into existence as a side effect.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"it is very clear that markets did spring up around ancient armies; one need only take a glance at Kautilya’s Arthasasatra, the Sassanian “circle of sovereignty,” or the Chinese “Discourses on Salt and Iron” to discover that most ancient rulers spent a great deal of their time thinking about the relation between mines, soldiers, taxes, and food. Most concluded that the creation of markets of this sort was not just convenient for feeding soldiers, but useful in all sorts of ways, since it meant officials no longer had to requisition everything they needed directly from the populace or figure out a way to produce it on royal estates or royal workshops. In other words, despite the dogged liberal assumption—again, coming from Smith’s legacy—that the existence of states and markets are somehow opposed, the historical record implies that exactly the opposite is the case. Stateless societies tend also to be without markets.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"L. Frank Baum’s book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which appeared in 1900, is widely recognized to be a parable for the Populist campaign of William Jennings Bryan, who twice ran for president on the Free Silver platform—vowing to replace the gold standard with a bimetallic system that would allow the free creation of silver money alongside gold.21 As with the Greenbackers, one of the main constituencies for the movement was debtors: particularly, Midwestern farm families such as Dorothy’s, who had been facing a massive wave of foreclosures during the severe recession of the 1890s. According to the Populist reading, the Wicked Witches of the East and West represent the East and West Coast bankers (promoters of and benefactors from the tight money supply), the Scarecrow represented the farmers (who didn’t have the brains to avoid the debt trap), the Tin Woodsman was the industrial proletariat (who didn’t have the heart to act in solidarity with the farmers), the Cowardly Lion represented the political class (who didn’t have the courage to intervene). The yellow brick road, silver slippers, emerald city, and hapless Wizard presumably speak for themselves.22 “Oz” is of course the standard abbreviation for “ounce.”23 As an attempt to create a new myth, Baum’s story was remarkably effective. As political propaganda, less so. William Jennings Bryan failed in three attempts to win the presidency, the silver standard was never adopted, and few nowadays even remember what The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was originally supposed to be about.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Richard Nixon’s decision in 1971 to unpeg the dollar from precious metals entirely, eliminate the international gold standard, and introduce the system of floating currency regimes that has dominated the world economy ever since. This meant in effect that all national currencies were henceforth, as neoclassical economists like to put it, “fiat money” backed only by the public trust.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The core argument is that any attempt to separate monetary policy from social policy is ultimately wrong. Primordial-debt theorists insist that these have always been the same thing. Governments use taxes to create money, and they are able to do so because they have become the guardians of the debt that all citizens have to one another. This debt is the essence of society itself. It exists long before money and markets, and money and markets themselves are simply ways of chopping pieces of it up.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The first kings were sacred kings who were either gods in their own right or stood as privileged mediators between human beings and the ultimate forces that governed the cosmos. This sets us on a road to the gradual realization that our debt to the gods was always, really, a debt to the society that made us what we are.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The “primordial debt,” writes British sociologist Geoffrey Ingham, “is that owed by the living to the continuity and durability of the society that secures their individual existence.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The German historian Bernard Laum long ago pointed out that in Homer, when people measure the value of a ship or suit of armor, they always measure it in oxen—even though when they actually exchange things, they never pay for anything in oxen. It is hard to escape the conclusion that this was because an ox was what one offered the gods in sacrifice.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"From Sumer to Classical Greece, silver and gold were dedicated as offerings in temples. Everywhere, money seems to have emerged from the thing most appropriate for giving to the gods.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If you start from the barter theory of money, you have to resolve the problem of how and why you would come to select one commodity to measure just how much you want each of the other ones. If you start from a credit theory, you are left with the problem I described in the first chapter: how to turn a moral obligation into a specific sum of money, how the mere sense of owing someone else a favor can eventually turn into a system of accounting in which one is able to calculate exactly how many sheep or fish or chunks of silver it would take to repay the debt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If taxes represent our absolute debt to the society that created us, then the first step toward creating real money comes when we start calculating much more specific debts to society, systems of fines, fees, and penalties, or even debts we owe to specific individuals who we have wronged in some way, and thus to whom we stand in a relation of “sin” or “guilt.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“primitive currencies” of this sort are only rarely used to buy and sell things, and even when they are, never primarily to buy and sell everyday items such as chickens or eggs or shoes or potatoes. Rather than being employed to acquire things, they are mainly used to rearrange relations between people. Above all, to arrange marriages and to settle disputes, particularly those arising from murders or personal injury. There is every reason to believe that our own money started the same way—even the English word “to pay” is originally derived from a word for “to pacify, appease”—as in, to give someone something precious, for instance, to express just how badly you feel about having just killed his brother in a drunken brawl, and how much you would really like to avoid this becoming the basis for an ongoing blood-feud.43\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If Henry gives Joshua a pig and feels he has received an inadequate counter-gift, he might mock Joshua as a cheapskate, but he would have little occasion to come up with a mathematical formula for precisely how cheap he feels Joshua has been. On the other hand, if Joshua’s pig just destroyed Henry’s garden, and especially, if that led to a fight in which Henry lost a toe, and Henry’s family is now hauling Joshua up in front of the village assembly—this is precisely the context where people are most likely to become petty and legalistic and express outrage if they feel they have received one groat less than was their rightful due. That means exact mathematical specificity: for instance, the capacity to measure the exact value of a two-year-old pregnant sow.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We don’t know precisely when and how interest-bearing loans originated, since they appear to predate writing.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Most likely, Temple administrators invented the idea as a way of financing the caravan trade. This trade was crucial because while the river valley of ancient Mesopotamia was extraordinarily fertile and produced huge surpluses of grain and other foodstuffs, and supported enormous numbers of livestock, which in turn supported a vast wool and leather industry, it was almost completely lacking in anything else.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"From quite early times, then, Temple administrators developed the habit of advancing goods to local merchants—some of them private, others themselves Temple functionaries—who would then go off and sell it overseas. Interest was just a way for the Temples to take their share of the resulting profits.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"These are also the intellectual and political circles that shaped the thought of Emile Durkheim, the founder of the discipline of sociology that we know today, who in a way did Comte one better by arguing that all gods in all religions are always already projections of society—so an explicit religion of society would not even be necessary. All religions, for Durkheim, are simply ways of recognizing our mutual dependence on one another, a dependence that affects us in a million ways that we are never entirely aware of. “God” and “society” are ultimately the same.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To take one notorious example, this was how the Soviet Union used to justify forbidding their citizens from emigrating to other countries. The argument was always: The USSR created these people, the USSR raised and educated them, made them who they are. What right do they have to take the product of our investment and transfer it to another country, as if they didn’t owe us anything? Neither is this rhetoric restricted to socialist regimes. Nationalists appeal to exactly the same kind of arguments—especially in times of war. And all modern governments are nationalist to some degree.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This is a great trap of the twentieth century: on one side is the logic of the market, where we like to imagine we all start out as individuals who don’t owe each other anything. On the other is the logic of the state, where we all begin with a debt we can never truly pay. We are constantly told that they are opposites and that between them they contain the only real human possibilities. But it’s a false dichotomy. States created markets. Markets require states. Neither could continue without the other, at least, in anything like the forms we would recognize today.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Look at a coin from your pocket. On one side is “heads”—the symbol of the political authority which minted the coin; on the other side is “tails”—the precise specification of the amount the coin is worth as payment in exchange. One side reminds us that states underwrite currencies and the money is originally a relation between persons in society, a token perhaps. The other reveals the coin as a thing, capable of entering into definite relations with other things.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in certain cities in nineteenth-century Siam, small change consisted entirely of porcelain Chinese gaming counters—basically, the equivalent of poker chips—issued by local casinos. If one of these casinos went out of business or lost its license, its owners would have to send a crier through the streets banging a gong and announcing that anyone holding such chits had three days to redeem them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Rather than seeing himself as human because he could make economic calculations, the hunter insisted that being truly human meant refusing to make such calculations, refusing to measure or remember who had given what to whom, for the precise reason that doing so would inevitably create a world where we began “comparing power with power, measuring, calculating” and reducing each other to slaves or dogs through debt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Christians practically say as much every time they recite the Lord’s Prayer and ask God to “forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.”25 It repeats the story of the parable almost exactly, and the implications are similarly dire. After all, most Christians reciting the prayer are aware that they do not generally forgive their debtors. Why then should God forgive them their sins?26\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Levi-Strauss, who became a kind of intellectual god in anthropology, made the extraordinary argument that human life could be imagined as consisting of three spheres: language (which consisted of the exchange of words), kinship (which consisted of the exchange of women), and economics (which consisted of the exchange of things). All three, he insisted, were governed by the same fundamental law of reciprocity.3\"\n\n---------\n\n\"while most of us can imagine what we owe to our parents as a kind of debt, few of us can imagine being able to actually pay it—or even that such a debt ever should be paid. Yet if it can’t be paid, in what sense is it a “debt” at all? And if it is not a debt, what is it?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All of us act like communists a good deal of the time. None of us act like a communist consistently. “Communist society”—in the sense of a society organized exclusively on that single principle—could never exist. But all social systems, even economic systems like capitalism, have always been built on top of a bedrock of actually-existing communism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One might even say that it’s one of the scandals of capitalism that most capitalist firms, internally, operate communistically. True, they don’t tend to operate very democratically. Most often they are organized around military-style top-down chains of command. But there is often an interesting tension here, because top-down chains of command are not particularly efficient: they tend to promote stupidity among those on top and resentful foot-dragging among those on the bottom. The greater the need to improvise, the more democratic the cooperation tends to become. Inventors have always understood this, start-up capitalists frequently figure it out, and computer engineers have recently rediscovered the principle: not only with things like freeware, which everyone talks about, but even in the organization of their businesses.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"communism is the foundation of all human sociability.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“baseline communism”: the understanding that, unless people consider themselves enemies, if the need is considered great enough, or the cost considered reasonable enough, the principle of “from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs” will be assumed to apply.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Baseline communism might be considered the raw material of sociality, a recognition of our ultimate interdependence that is the ultimate substance of social peace.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kings knew that the really important game was not economic, but one of status, and theirs was absolute.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the logic of identity is, always and everywhere, entangled in the logic of hierarchy. It is only when certain people are placed above others, or where everyone is being ranked in relation to the king, or the high priest, or Founding Fathers, that one begins to speak of people bound by their essential nature: about fundamentally different kinds of human being.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When objects of material wealth pass back and forth between superiors and inferiors as gifts or payments, the key principle seems to be that the sorts of things given on each side should be considered fundamentally different in quality, their relative value impossible to quantify—the result being that there is no way to even conceive of a squaring of accounts. Even if Medieval writers insisted on imagining society as a hierarchy in which priests pray for everyone, nobles fight for everyone, and peasants feed everyone, it never even occurred to any of them to establish how many prayers or how much military protection was equivalent to a ton of wheat. Nor did anyone ever consider making such a calculation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"one could judge how egalitarian a society really was by exactly this: whether those ostensibly in positions of authority are merely conduits for redistribution, or able to use their positions to accumulate riches.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"often admit this, if you ask them in the right way. Markets aren’t real. They are mathematical models, created by imagining a self-contained world where everyone has exactly the same motivation and the same knowledge and is engaged in the same self-interested calculating exchange. Economists are aware that reality is always more complicated; but they are also aware that to come up with a mathematical model, one always has to make the world into a bit of a cartoon.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even in the Bible, the admonition in the Ten Commandments not to “covet thy neighbor’s wife” clearly referred not to lust in one’s heart (adultery had already been covered in commandment number seven), but to the prospect of taking her as a debt-peon—in other words, as a servant to sweep one’s yard and hang out the laundry.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Historically, commercial economies—market economies, as we now like to call them—are a relative newcomer. For most of human history, human economies predominated.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When a Fijian suitor’s family presents a whale tooth to ask for a woman’s hand in marriage, is this an advance payment for the services the woman will provide in cultivating her future husband’s gardens? Or is he purchasing the future fertility of her womb? Or is this a pure formality, the equivalent of the dollar that has to change hands in order to seal a contract? According to Rospabé, it’s none of these. The whale tooth, however valuable, is not a form of payment. It is really an acknowledgment that one is asking for something so uniquely valuable that payment of any sort would be impossible. The only appropriate payment for the gift of a woman is the gift of another woman; in the meantime, all one can do is to acknowledge the outstanding debt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Money, then, begins, as Rospabé himself puts it, “as a substitute for life.”14 One might call it the recognition of a life-debt. This, in turn, explains why it’s invariably the exact same kind of money that’s used to arrange marriages that is also used to pay wergeld (or “bloodwealth,” as it’s sometimes also called): money presented to the family of a murder victim so as to prevent or resolve a blood-feud.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Money almost always arises first from objects that are used primarily as adornment of the person. Beads, shells, feathers, dog or whale teeth, gold, and silver are all well-known cases in point. All are useless for any purpose other than making people look more interesting, and hence, more beautiful. The brass rods used by the Tiv might seem an exception, but actually they’re not: they were used mainly as raw material for the manufacture of jewelry, or simply twisted into hoops and worn at dances. There are exceptions (cattle, for instance), but as a general rule, it’s only when governments, and then markets, enter the picture that we begin to see currencies like barley, cheese, tobacco, or salt.40\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The slave trade, of course, represented violence on an entirely different scale. We are speaking here of destruction of genocidal proportions, in world-historic terms, comparable only to events like the destruction of New World civilizations or the Holocaust. Neither do I mean in any way to blame the victims: we need only imagine what would be likely to happen in our own society if a group of space aliens suddenly appeared, armed with undefeatable military technology, infinite wealth, and no recognizable morality—and announced that they were willing to pay a million dollars each for human workers, no questions asked. There will always be at least a handful of people unscrupulous enough to take advantage of such a situation—and a handful is all it takes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"How common was this? The African slave trade was, as I mentioned, an unprecedented catastrophe, but commercial economies had already been extracting slaves from human economies for thousands of years. It is a practice as old as civilization.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"there is every reason to believe that slavery, with its unique ability to rip human beings from their contexts, to turn them into abstractions, played a key role in the rise of markets everywhere.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"At the very least, there was always seen to be something disreputable and ugly about slavery. Anyone too close to it was tainted. Slave-traders particularly were scorned as inhuman brutes. Throughout history, moral justifications for slavery are rarely taken particularly seriously even by those who espouse them. For most of human history, most people saw slavery much as we see war: a tawdry business, to be sure, but one would have to be naïve indeed to imagine it could simply be eliminated.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Slavery is the ultimate form of being ripped from one’s context, and thus from all the social relationships that make one a human being. Another way to put this is that the slave is, in a very real sense, dead.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"one becomes a slave in situations where one would otherwise have died. This is obvious in the case of war: in the ancient world, the victor was assumed to have total power over the vanquished, including their women and children; all of them could be simply massacred. Similarly, he argued, criminals were condemned to slavery only for capital crimes, and those who sold themselves, or their children, normally faced starvation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"slave could not owe debts, because in almost every important sense, a slave was dead. In Roman law, this was quite explicit. If a Roman soldier was captured and lost his liberty, his family was expected to read his will and dispose of his possessions. Should he later regain his freedom, he would have to start over, even to the point of remarrying the woman who was now considered his widow.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What makes Medieval Irish laws seem so peculiar from our perspective is that their exponents had not the slightest discomfort with putting an exact monetary price on human dignity. For us, the notion that the sanctity of a priest or the majesty of a king could be held equivalent to a million fried eggs or a hundred thousand haircuts is simply bizarre. These are precisely the things that ought to be considered beyond all possibility of quantification. If Medieval Irish jurists felt otherwise, it was because people at that time did not use money to buy eggs or haircuts.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Already by the age of Socrates, while a man’s honor was increasingly tied to disdain for commerce and assertiveness in public life, a woman’s honor had come to be defined in almost exclusively sexual terms: as a matter of virginity, modesty, and chastity, to the extent that respectable women were expected to be shut up inside the household and any woman who played a part in public life was considered for that reason a prostitute, or tantamount to one.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the thing that really seemed to bother them about money was simply that they wanted it so much. Since money could be used to buy just about anything, everybody wanted it. That is: it was desirable because it was non-discriminating. One could see how the metaphor of the porne might seem particularly appropriate. A woman “common to the people”—as the poet Archilochos put it—is available to everyone. In principle, we shouldn’t be attracted to such an undiscriminating creature. In fact, of course, we are.68 And nothing was both so undiscriminating, and so desirable, as money.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"money introduced a democratization of desire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the first century AD, for example, it was not uncommon for educated Greeks to have themselves sold into slavery to some wealthy Roman in need of a secretary, entrust the money to a close friend or family member, and then, after a certain interval, buy themselves back, thus obtaining Roman citizenship. This despite the fact that, during such time as they were slaves, if their owner decided to, say, cut one of his secretary’s feet off, legally, he would have been perfectly free to do so.109\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This is why I developed the concept of human economies: ones in which what is considered really important about human beings is the fact that they are each a unique nexus of relations with others—therefore, that no one could ever be considered exactly equivalent to anything or anyone else. In a human economy, money is not a way of buying or trading human beings, but a way of expressing just how much one cannot do so.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"an ancient Greek would certainly have seen the distinction between a slave and an indebted wage laborer as, at best, a legalistic nicety.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is a shape to the past, and it is only by understanding it that we can begin to have a sense of the historical opportunities that exist in the present.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Coinage appears to have arisen independently in three different places, almost simultaneously: on the Great Plain of northern China, in the Ganges river valley of northeast India, and in the lands surrounding the Aegean Sea, in each case, between roughly 600 and 500 BC. This wasn’t due to some sudden technological innovation: the technologies used in making the first coins were, in each case, entirely different.4 It was a social transformation. Why this happened in exactly this way is an historical mystery. But this much we know: for some reason, in Lydia, India, and China, local rulers decided that whatever longstanding credit systems had existed in their kingdoms were no longer adequate, and they began to issue tiny pieces of precious metals—metals that had previously been used largely in international commerce, in ingot form—and to encourage their subjects to use them in day-to-day transactions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For much of human history, then, an ingot of gold or silver, stamped or not, has served the same role as the contemporary drug dealer’s suitcase full of unmarked bills: an object without a history, valuable because one knows it will be accepted in exchange for other goods just about anywhere, no questions asked.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"while credit systems tend to dominate in periods of relative social peace, or across networks of trust (whether created by states or, in most periods, transnational institutions like merchant guilds or communities of faith), in periods characterized by widespread war and plunder, they tend to be replaced by precious metal. What’s more, while predatory lending goes on in every period of human history, the resulting debt crises appear to have the most damaging effects at times when money is most easily convertible into cash.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"is also one of the earliest mentions of a debt prison.21 Under the Ptolemies, the Greek dynasty that ruled Egypt after Alexander, periodic clean slates had become institutionized.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Jaspers became fascinated by the fact that figures like Pythagoras (570–495 BC), the Buddha (563–483 BC), and Confucius (551–479 BC) were all alive at exactly the same time, and that Greece, India, and China, in that period, all saw a sudden efflorescence of debate between contending intellectual schools, each group apparently unaware of the others’ existence.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For Jaspers, the period begins with the Persian prophet Zoroaster, around 800 BC, and ends around 200 BC, to be followed by a Spiritual Age that centers on figures like Jesus and Mohammed. For my own purposes, I find it more useful to combine the two. Let us define the Axial Age, then, as running from 800 BC to 600 AD.3 This makes the Axial Age the period that saw the birth not only of all the world’s major philosophical tendencies, but also all of today’s major world religions: Zoroastrianism, Prophetic Judaism, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam.4\"\n\n---------\n\n\"one theory is that the very first Lydian coins were invented explicitly to pay mercenaries.11 This might help explain why the Greeks, who supplied most of the mercenaries, so quickly became accustomed to the use of coins, and why the use of coinage spread so quickly across the Hellenic world, so that by 480 BC there were at least one hundred mints operating in different Greek cities, even though at that time, none of the great trading nations of the Mediterranean had as yet showed the slightest interest in them. The Phoenicians, for example, were considered the greatest merchants and bankers of antiquity.12 They were also great inventors, having been the first to develop both the alphabet and the abacus. Yet for centuries after the invention of coinage, they preferred to continue conducting business as they always had, with unwrought ingots and promissory notes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In brief, one might say that these conflicts over debt had two possible outcomes. The first was that the aristocrats could win, and the poor remain “slaves of the rich”—which in practice meant that most people would end up clients of some wealthy patron. Such states were generally militarily ineffective.16 The second was that popular factions could prevail, institute the usual popular program of redistribution of lands and safeguards against debt peonage, thus creating the basis for a class of free farmers whose children would, in turn, be free to spend much of their time training for war.17 Coinage played a critical role in maintaining this kind of free peasantry—secure in their landholding, not tied to any great lord by bonds of debt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Alexander’s army, which numbered some 120,000 men, required half a ton of silver a day just for wages.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Kautilya’s Arthasastra, a political treatise written by one of the chief ministers for the Mauryan dynasty that succeeded it (321–185 BC), stated the matter precisely: “The treasury is based upon mining, the army upon the treasury; he who has army and treasury may conquer the whole wide earth.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Greek sources report that Magadha could put to the field a force of 200,000 infantry, 20,000 horses, and about 4,000 elephants—and that Alexander’s men mutinied rather than have to face them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"state was inserting itself into every aspect of the process: Kautilya suggests paying soldiers apparently generous wages, then secretly replacing hawkers with government agents who could charge them twice the normal rates for supplies, as well as organizing prostitutes under a ministry in which they could be trained as spies, so as to make detailed reports on their clients’ loyalties.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To understand what had changed, we have to look, again, at the particular kind of markets that were emerging at the beginning of the Axial Age: impersonal markets, born of war, in which it was possible to treat even neighbors as if they were strangers.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As a general principle, when an enemy’s army comes, it seeks some profit. Now if they come and find the prospect of death instead, they will consider running away the most profitable thing to do. When all one’s enemies consider running to be the most profitable thing to do, no blades will cross. This is the most essential point in military matters.57\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the numerous manuals on statecraft produced at the time, everything was cast as a matter of recognizing interest and advantage, calculating how to balance that which will profit the ruler against that which will profit the people, determining when the ruler’s interests are the same as the people’s and when they contradict.58\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Rather than offering to provide candles for a specific ritual, or servants to attend to the upkeep of the monastic grounds, she would provide a certain sum of money—or something worth a great deal of money—that would then be loaned out in the name of the monastery, at the accepted 15-percent annual rate. The interest on the loan would then be earmarked for that specific purpose.5 An inscription discovered at the Great Monastery of Sanci sometime around 450 AD provides a handy illustration. A woman named Harisvamini donates the relatively modest sum of twelve dinaras to the “Noble Community of Monks.”6 The text carefully inscribes how the income is to be divided up: the interest on five of the dinaras was to provide daily meals for five different monks, the interest from another three would pay to light three lamps for the Buddha, in memory of her parents, and so forth. The inscription ends by saying that this was a permanent endowment, “created with a document in stone to last as long as the moon and the sun”: since the principal would never be touched, the contribution would last forever.7\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There were decades in Chinese history when the rate of recorded peasant uprisings was roughly 1.8 per hour.21 What’s more, such uprisings were frequently successful. Most of the most famous Chinese dynasties that were not the product of barbarian invasion (the Yuan or Qing) were originally peasant insurrections (the Han, Tang, Sung, and Ming). In no other part of the world do we see anything like this.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We are used to thinking of such bureaucratic interventions—particularly the monopolies and regulations—as state restriction on “the market”—owing to the prevailing prejudice that sees markets as quasi-natural phenomena that emerge by themselves, and governments as having no role other than to squelch or siphon from them. I have repeatedly pointed out how mistaken this is, but China provides a particularly striking example.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Confucian state may have been the world’s greatest and most enduring bureaucracy, but it actively promoted markets, and as a result, commercial life in China soon became far more sophisticated, and markets more developed, than anywhere else in the world.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Normally, the easiest way to do this is by establishing some kind of formal or de facto monopoly. For this reason, capitalists, whether merchant princes, financiers, or industrialists, invariably try to ally themselves with political authorities to limit the freedom of the market, so as to make it easier for them to do so.27 From this perspective, China was for most of its history the ultimate anti-capitalist market state.28 Unlike later European princes, Chinese rulers systematically refused to team up with would-be Chinese capitalists (who always existed).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Tallies weren’t just used for loans, but for any sort of contract—which is why early paper contracts also had to be cut in half and one half kept by each party.52 With paper contracts, there was a definite tendency for the creditor’s half to function as an IOU and thus become transferable.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By the early Song dynasty (960–1279 AD), local banking operations all over China were running similar operations, accepting cash and bullion for safekeeping and allowing depositors to use their receipts as promissory notes, as well as trading in government coupons for salt and tea. Many of these notes came to circulate as de facto money.54\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In Islamic society, the merchant became not just a respected figure, but a kind of paragon: like the warrior, a man of honor able to pursue far-flung adventures; unlike him, able to do so in a fashion damaging to no one.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The veneration of the merchant was matched by what can only be called the world’s first popular free-market ideology. True, one should be careful not to confuse ideals with reality. Markets were ever entirely independent from the government. Islamic regimes did employ all the usual strategies of manipulating tax policy to encourage the growth of markets, and they periodically tried to intervene in commercial law.81 Still, there was a very strong popular feeling that they shouldn’t.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In fact, many of the specific arguments and examples that Smith uses appear to trace back directly to economic tracts written in medieval Persia. For instance, not only does his argument that exchange is a natural outgrowth of human rationality and speech already appear both in both Ghazali (1058–1111 AD) and Tusi (1201–1274 AD); both use exactly the same illustration: that no one has ever observed two dogs exchanging bones.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The differences, however, are just as significant as the similarities. One telling example: like Smith, Tusi begins his treatise on economics with a discussion of the division of labor; but where for Smith, the division of labor is actually an outgrowth of our “natural propensity to truck and barter” in pursuit of individual advantage, for Tusi, it was an extension of mutual aid:\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A thing can only be exactly linked to other things if it has no particular special form or feature of its own—for example, a mirror that has no color can reflect all colors. The same is the case with money—it has no purpose of its own, but it serves as medium for the purpose of exchanging goods.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"From this it also follows that lending money at interest must be illegitimate, since it means using money as an end in itself: “Money is not created to earn money.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"spread of Islam allowed the market to become a global phenomenon, operating largely independent of governments, according to its own internal laws.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Such stories about the extraction of Jewish teeth, skin, and intestines are, I think, important to bear in mind when thinking about Shakespeare’s imaginary Merchant of Venice demanding his “pound of flesh.”117 It all seems to have been a bit of a guilty projection of terrors that Jews had never really visited on Christians, but that had been directed the other way around.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the persecutions and appropriations were an extension of the logic whereby kings effectively treated debts owed to Jews as ultimately owed to themselves, even setting up a branch of the Treasury (“the Exchequer of the Jews”) to manage them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Our image of the Middle Ages as an “age of faith”—and hence, of blind obedience to authority—is a legacy of the French Enlightenment. Again, it makes sense only if you think of the “Middle Ages” as something that happened primarily in Europe. Not only was the Far West an unusually violent place by world standards, the Catholic Church was extraordinarily intolerant. It’s hard to find many medieval Chinese, Indian, or Islamic parallels, for example, to the burning of “witches” or the massacre of heretics. More typical was the pattern that prevailed in certain periods of Chinese history, when it was perfectly acceptable for a scholar to dabble in Taoism in his youth, become a Confucian in middle age, then become a Buddhist on retirement.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When Aristotle argued that coins are merely social conventions, the term he used was symbolon—from which our own word “symbol” is derived. Symbolon was originally the Greek word for “tally”—an object broken in half to mark a contract or agreement, or marked and broken to record a debt. So our word “symbol” traces back originally to objects broken to record debt contracts of one sort or another. This is striking enough. What’s really remarkable, though, is that the contemporary Chinese word for “symbol,” fu, or fu hao, has almost exactly the same origin.148\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the world of Islam, where theologians held that God recreated the entire universe at every instant, market fluctuations were instead seen as merely another manifestation of divine will.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The striking thing is that the Confucian condemnation of the merchant and the Islamic celebration of the merchant ultimately led to the same thing: prosperous societies with flourishing markets, but where the elements never came together to create the great merchant banks and industrial firms that were to become the hallmark of modern capitalism. It’s especially striking in the case of Islam.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"At the height of the Caliphate, some of these merchants were in possession of millions of dinars and seeking profitable investment. Why did nothing like modern capitalism emerge? I would highlight two factors. First, Islamic merchants appear to have taken their free-market ideology seriously. The marketplace did not fall under the direct supervision of the government; contracts were made between individuals—ideally, “with a handshake and a glance at heaven”—and thus honor and credit became largely indistinguishable. This is inevitable: you can’t have cutthroat competition where there is no one stopping people from literally cutting one another’s throats. Second, Islam also took seriously the principle, later enshrined in classical economic theory but only unevenly observed in practice, that profits are the reward for risk.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Financial mechanisms designed to avoid these risks were considered impious. This was one of the objections to usury: if one demands a fixed rate of interest, the profits are guaranteed.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Inexhaustible Treasuries were inexhaustible because, by continually lending their money out at interest and never otherwise touching their capital, they could guarantee effectively risk-free investments. That was the entire point. By doing so, Buddhism, unlike Islam, produced something very much like what we now call “corporations”—entities that, through a charming legal fiction, we imagine to be persons, just like human beings, but immortal, never having to go through all the human untidiness of marriage, reproduction, infirmity, and death. To put it in properly medieval terms, they are very much like angels.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The legal idea of a corporation as a “fictive person” (persona ficta)—a person who, as Maitland, the great British legal historian, put it, “is immortal, who sues and is sued, who holds lands, has a seal of his own, who makes regulations for those natural persons of whom he is composed”166—was first established in canon law by Pope Innocent IV in 1250 AD, and one of the first kinds of entities it applied to were monasteries—as also to universities, churches, municipalities, and guilds.167\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All this is worth emphasizing because while we are used to assuming that there’s something natural or inevitable about the existence of corporations, in historical terms, they are actually strange, exotic creatures. No other great tradition came up with anything like it.170 They are the most peculiarly European addition to that endless proliferation of metaphysical entities so characteristic of the Middle Ages—as well as the most enduring.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Between 1500 and 1650, for instance, prices in England increased 500 percent, but wages rose much more slowly, so that in five generations, real wages fell to perhaps 40 percent of what they had been. The same thing happened everywhere in Europe. Why? The favorite explanation, ever since a French lawyer named Jean Bodin first proposed it in 1568, was the vast influx of gold and silver that came pouring into Europe after the conquest of the New World. As the value of precious metals collapsed, the argument went, the price of everything else skyrocketed, and wages simply couldn’t keep up.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the Chinese government had gone back to its old policy of encouraging markets and merely intervening to prevent any undue concentrations of capital. It quickly proved spectacularly successful, and Chinese markets boomed. Indeed, many speak of the Ming as having accomplished something almost unique in world history: this was a time when the Chinese population was exploding, but living standards markedly improved.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Had China in particular not had such a dynamic economy that changing its metallic base could absorb the staggering quantities of silver mined in the New World over three centuries, those mines might have become unprofitable within a few decades. The massive inflation of silver-denominated prices in Europe from 1500 to 1640 indicates a shrinking value for the metal there even with Asia draining off much of the supply.8\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Or if there is a demand for sugar in England, and enslaving millions is the easiest way to acquire labor to produce it, then it is inevitable that some will enslave them. In fact, history makes it quite clear that this is not the case. Any number of civilizations have probably been in a position to wreak havoc on the scale that the European powers did in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Ming China itself was an obvious candidate), but almost none actually did so.12\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When dealing with conquistadors, we are speaking not just of simple greed, but greed raised to mythic proportions. This is, after all, what they are best remembered for. They never seemed to get enough.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Money always has the potential to become a moral imperative unto itself. Allow it to expand and it can quickly become a morality so imperative that all others seem frivolous in comparison.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The structure of the corporation is a telling case in point—and it is no coincidence that the first major joint-stock corporations in the world were the English and Dutch East India companies, ones that pursued that very same combination of exploration, conquest, and extraction as did the conquistadors.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"is a structure designed to eliminate all moral imperatives but profit. The executives who make decisions can argue—and regularly do—that, if it were their own money, of course they would not fire lifelong employees a week before retirement, or dump carcinogenic waste next to schools. Yet they are morally bound to ignore such considerations, because they are mere employees whose only responsibility is to provide the maximum return on investment for the company’s stockholders. (The stockholders, of course, are not given any say.)\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Capital, then, is not simply money. It is not even just wealth that can be turned into money. But neither is it just the use of political power to help one use one’s money to make more money.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The history of modern financial instruments, and the ultimate origins of paper money, really begin with the issuing of municipal bonds—a practice begun by the Venetian government in the twelfth century when, needing a quick infusion of income for military purposes, it levied a compulsory loan on its taxpaying citizens, for which it promised each of them five percent annual interest, and allowed the “bonds” or contracts to become negotiable, thus creating a market in government debt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the Bank of England was created when a consortium of forty London and Edinburgh merchants—mostly already creditors to the crown—offered King William III a £1.2 million loan to help finance his war against France. In doing so, they also convinced him to allow them in return to form a corporation with a monopoly on the issuance of banknotes—which were, in effect, promissory notes for the money the king now owed them. This was the first independent national central bank, and it became the clearinghouse for debts owed between smaller banks; the notes soon developed into the first European national paper currency.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Dutch Republic, which pioneered the development of stock markets, had already experienced this in the tulip mania of 1637—the first of a series of speculative “bubbles,” as they came to be known, in which future prices would first be bid through the ceiling by investors and then collapse.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The famous South Sea Bubble in 1720—in which a newly formed trading company, granted a monopoly of trade with the Spanish colonies, bought up a considerable portion of the British national debt and saw its shares briefly skyrocket before collapsing in ignominy—was only the culmination.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“You have plenty of gold lying somewhere underneath your lands,” notes Faust. “Just issue notes promising your creditors you’ll give it to them later. Since no one knows how much gold there really is, there’s no limit to how much you can promise.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"They had a much more fundamental problem with the market: greed. Market motives were held to be inherently corrupt. The moment that greed was validated and unlimited profit was considered a perfectly viable end in itself, this political, magical element became a genuine problem, because it meant that even those actors—the brokers, stock-jobbers, traders—who effectively made the system run had no convincing loyalty to anything, even to the system itself.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It would seem that almost all elements of financial apparatus that we’ve come to associate with capitalism—central banks, bond markets, short-selling, brokerage houses, speculative bubbles, securization, annuities—came into being not only before the science of economics (which is perhaps not too surprising), but also before the rise of factories, and wage labor itself.88 This is a genuine challenge to familiar ways of thinking. We like to think of the factories and workshops as the “real economy,” and the rest as superstructure, constructed on top of it. But if this were really so, then how can it be that the superstructure came first? Can the dreams of the system create its body?\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The word was originally invented by socialists, who saw capitalism as that system whereby those who own capital command the labor of those who do not.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Proponents, in contrast, tend to see capitalism as the freedom of the marketplace, which allows those with potentially marketable visions to pull resources together to bring those visions into being.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For a century, one such private, profit-seeking corporation governed India. The national debts of England, France, and the others were based in money borrowed not to dig canals and erect bridges, but to acquire the gunpowder needed to bombard cities and to construct the camps required for the holding of prisoners and the training of recruits.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Europeans had no compunctions about aggressively marketing opium in China as a way of finally putting an end to the need to export bullion. The cloth trade only came later, after the East India Company used military force to shut down the (more efficient) Indian cotton export trade.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"British overlords in India, starting with the East India Company but continuing under Her Majesty’s government, institutionalized debt peonage as their primary means of creating products for sale abroad.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Our dominant image of the origins of capitalism continues to be the English workingman toiling in the factories of the industrial revolution, and this image can be traced forward to Silicon Valley, with a straight line in between. All those millions of slaves and serfs and coolies and debt peons disappear, or if we must speak of them, we write them off as temporary bumps along the road. Like sweatshops, this is assumed to be a stage that industrializing nations had to pass through, just as it is still assumed that all those millions of debt peons and contract laborers and sweatshop workers who still exist, often in the same places, will surely live to see their children become regular wage laborers with health insurance and pensions, and their children, doctors and lawyers and entrepreneurs.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is, and has always been, a curious affinity between wage labor and slavery. This is not just because it was slaves on Caribbean sugar plantations who supplied the quick-energy products that powered much of early wage laborers’ work; not just because most of the scientific management techniques applied in factories in the industrial revolution can be traced back to those sugar plantations; but also because both the relation between master and slave, and between employer and employee, are in principle impersonal: whether you’ve been sold or you’re simply rented yourself out, the moment money changes hands, who you are is supposed to be unimportant; all that’s important is that you are capable of understanding orders and doing what you’re told.101\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We are, nowadays, used to associating factories eighteen months in arrears for wages with a nation in economic free-fall, such as occurred during the collapse of the Soviet Union; but owing to the hard-money policies of the British government, who were always concerned above all to ensure that their paper money didn’t float away in another speculative bubble, in the early days of industrial capitalism, such a situation was in no way unusual. Even the government was often unable to find the cash to pay its own employees.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"for those who spend most of their waking hours working at someone else’s orders, the ability to pull out a wallet full of banknotes that are unconditionally one’s own can be a compelling form of freedom.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Let me fill in some of the gaps in our story. After burning his boats, Cortés began to assemble an army of local allies, which was easy to do because the Aztecs were widely hated, and then he began to march on the Aztec capital. Moctezuma, the Aztec emperor, who had been monitoring the situation closely, concluded that he needed to at least figure out what sort of people he was dealing with, so he invited the entire Spanish force (only a few hundred men) to be his official guests in Tenochtitlán. This eventually led to a series of palace intrigues during which Cortés’s men briefly held the emperor hostage before being forcibly expelled.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There were similar rules in board games, such as Cortés and Moctezuma were playing: if, by some freak stroke of luck, one of the dice landed on its edge, the game was over, and the winner took everything. This, Clenninden suggests, must have been what Moctezuma was really waiting for. After all, he was clearly in the middle of extraordinary events. Strange creatures had appeared, apparently from nowhere, with unheard-of powers. Rumors of epidemics, of the destruction of nearby nations, had presumably already reached him. If ever there was a time that some grandiose revelation was due from the gods, then surely this was it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Moctezuma was above all a warrior, and all warriors are gamblers; but unlike Cortés, he was clearly in every way a man of honor. As we’ve also seen, the quintessence of a warrior’s honor, which is a greatness that can only come from the destruction and degradation of others, is his willingness to throw himself into a game where he risks that same destruction and degradation himself—and, unlike Cortés, to play graciously, and by the rules.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"there may be a deeper, more profound relation between gambling and apocalypse. Capitalism is a system that enshrines the gambler as an essential part of its operation, in a way that no other ever has; yet at the same time, capitalism seems to be uniquely incapable of conceiving of its own eternity.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"they insist that it is the only possible viable economic system: one that, as they still sometimes like to say, “has existed for five thousand years and will exist for five thousand more.” On the other hand, it does seem that the moment a significant portion of the population begins to actually believe this and, particularly, starts treating credit institutions as if they really will be around forever, everything goes haywire. Note here how it was the most sober, cautious, responsible capitalist regimes—the seventeenth-century Dutch Republic, the eighteenth-century British Commonwealth—the ones most careful about managing their public debt—that saw the most bizarre explosions of speculative frenzy, the tulip manias and South Sea bubbles.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the French Revolution introduced several profoundly new ideas in politics—ideas which, fifty years before the revolution, the vast majority of educated Europeans would have written off as crazy, but which, fifty years afterward, just about anyone felt they had to at least pretend they thought were true.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The first is that social change is inevitable and desirable: that the natural direction of history is for civilization to gradually improve. The second is that the appropriate agent to manage such change is the government. The third is that the government gains its legitimacy from an entity called “the people.”111\"\n\n---------\n\n\"a strange story because we are used to thinking of the Enlightenment as the dawn of a unique phase of human optimism, borne on assumptions that the advance of science and human knowledge would inevitably make life wiser, safer, and better for everyone—a naïve faith said to have peaked in the Fabian socialism of the 1890s, only to be annihilated in the trenches of World War I.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In Chicago, for instance, a friend once took me on a drive down a beautiful old street, full of mansions from the 1870s: the reason, he explained, that it looked like that, was that most of Chicago’s rich industrialists of the time were so convinced that the revolution was immanent that they collectively relocated along the road that led to the nearest military base.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Almost none of the great theorists of capitalism, from anywhere on the political spectrum, from Marx to Weber, to Schumpeter, to von Mises, felt that capitalism was likely to be around for more than another generation or two at the most.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"it does seem strange that capitalism feels the constant need to imagine, or to actually manufacture, the means of its own imminent extinction.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Presented with the prospect of its own eternity, capitalism—or anyway, financial capitalism—simply explodes. Because if there’s no end to it, there’s absolutely no reason not to generate credit—that is, future money—infinitely. Recent events would certainly seem to confirm this. The period leading up to 2008 was one in which many began to believe that capitalism really was going to be around forever; at the very least, no one seemed any longer to be able to imagine an alternative. The immediate effect was a series of increasingly reckless bubbles that brought the whole apparatus crashing down.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"ON AUGUST 15, 1971, United States President Richard Nixon announced that foreign-held U.S. dollars would no longer be convertible into gold—thus stripping away the last vestige of the international gold standard.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The consensus among historians is that Nixon had little choice. His hand was forced by the rising costs of the Vietnam War—one that, like all capitalist wars, had been financed by deficit spending. The United States was in possession of a large proportion of the world’s gold reserves in its vaults in Fort Knox (though increasingly less in the late 1960s, as other governments, most famously Charles de Gaulle’s France, began demanding gold for their dollars);\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The immediate effect of Nixon’s unpegging the dollar was to cause the price of gold to skyrocket; it hit a peak of $600 an ounce in 1980. This of course had the effect of causing U.S. gold reserves to increase dramatically in value.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"little research and discovered that, no, actually, it’s true. The United States Treasury’s gold reserves are indeed kept at Fort Knox, but the Federal Reserve’s gold reserves, and those of more than one hundred other central banks, governments, and organizations, are stored in vaults under the Federal Reserve building at 33 Liberty Street in Manhattan, two blocks away from the Towers.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“The gold stored at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is secured in a most unusual vault. It rests on the bedrock of Manhattan Island—one of the few foundations considered adequate to support the weight of the vault, its door, and the gold inside—eighty feet below street level and fifty feet below sea level … To reach the vault, bullion-laden pallets must be loaded into one of the Bank’s elevators and sent down five floors below street level to the vault floor … If everything is in order, the gold is either moved to one or more of the vault’s 122 compartments assigned to depositing countries and official international organizations or placed on shelves. ‘Gold stackers,’ using hydraulic lifts, do indeed shift them back and forth between compartments to balance credits and debts, though the vaults have only numbers, so even the workers don’t know who is paying whom.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Under the free-market orthodoxy that followed, we have all been asked, effectively, to accept that “the market” is a self-regulating system, with the rising and falling of prices akin to a force of nature, and simultaneously to ignore the fact that, in the business pages, it is simply assumed that markets rise and fall mainly in anticipation of, or reaction to, decisions regarding interest rates by Alan Greenspan, or Ben Bernanke, or whoever is currently the chairman of the Federal Reserve.5\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There’s a reason why the wizard has such a strange capacity to create money out of nothing. Behind him, there’s a man with a gun.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"causing such an enormous strain on the U.S. gold reserves. Many hold that by floating the dollar, Nixon converted the U.S. currency into pure “fiat money”—mere pieces of paper, intrinsically worthless, that were treated as money only because the United States government insisted that they should be. In that case, one could well argue that U.S. military power was now the only thing backing up the currency.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the U.S. government can’t “just print money,” because American money is not issued by the government at all, but by private banks, under the aegis of the Federal Reserve System.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Federal Reserve—despite the name—is technically not part of the government at all, but a peculiar sort of public-private hybrid, a consortium of privately owned banks whose chairman is appointed by the United States president, with Congressional approval, but which otherwise operates without public oversight.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The arrangement is just a variation of the scheme originally pioneered by the Bank of England, whereby the Fed “loans” money to the United States government by purchasing treasury bonds, and then monetizes the U.S. debt by lending the money thus owed by the government to other banks.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The difference is that while the Bank of England originally loaned the king gold, the Fed simply whisks the money into existence by saying that it’s there. Thus, it’s the Fed that has the power to print money.10\"\n\n---------\n\n\"apparently paradoxical result of Nixon’s floating the currency was that these bank-created dollars themselves replaced gold as the world’s reserve currency: that is, as the ultimate store of value in the world, yielding the United States enormous economic advantages.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Meanwhile, the U.S. debt remains, as it has been since 1790, a war debt: the United States continues to spend more on its military than do all other nations on earth put together, and military expenditures are not only the basis of the government’s industrial policy; they also take up such a huge proportion of the budget that by many estimations, were it not for them, the United States would not run a deficit at all. The U.S. military, unlike any other, maintains a doctrine of global power projection: that it should have the ability, through roughly 800 overseas military bases, to intervene with deadly force absolutely anywhere on the planet.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The essence of U.S. military predominance in the world is, ultimately, the fact that it can, at will, with only a few hours’ notice, drop bombs at absolutely any point on the surface of the planet.11 No other government has ever had anything remotely like this sort of capability.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"a case could well be made that it is this very power that holds the entire world monetary system, organized around the dollar, together.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"effect of Nixon’s floating of the dollar was that foreign central banks have little they can do with these dollars except to use them to buy U.S. treasury bonds.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"over time, the combined effect of low interest payments and the inflation is that these bonds actually depreciate in value—adding to the tax effect, or, as I preferred to put it in the first chapter, “tribute.” Economists prefer to call it “seigniorage.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What’s more, the global status of the dollar is maintained in large part by the fact that it is, again since 1971, the only currency used to buy and sell petroleum, with any attempt by OPEC countries to begin trading in any currency stubbornly resisted by OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Kuwait—also U.S. military protectorates.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When Saddam Hussein made the bold move of singlehandedly switching from the dollar to the euro in 2000, followed by Iran in 2001, this was quickly followed by American bombing and military occupation.14 How much Hussein’s decision to buck the dollar really weighed into the U.S. decision to depose him is impossible to know, but no country in a position to make a similar switch can ignore the possibility.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If history holds true, an age of virtual money should mean a movement away from war, empire-building, slavery, and debt peonage (waged or otherwise), and toward the creation of some sort of overarching institutions, global in scale, to protect debtors.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"IMF policies of insisting that debts be repaid almost exclusively from the pockets of the poor were met by an equally global movement of social rebellion (the so-called “anti-globalization movement”—though the name is profoundly deceptive), followed by outright fiscal rebellion in both East Asia and Latin America. By 2000, East Asian countries had begun a systematic boycott of the IMF. In 2002, Argentina committed the ultimate sin: they defaulted—and got away with it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Seemingly everywhere he went on a recent tour of China, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher was asked to deliver a message to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke: “stop cre–ating credit out of thin air to purchase U.S. Treasuries.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Some might question why, if these really are tribute payments, the United States’ major rival would be buying treasury bonds to begin with—let alone agreeing to various tacit monetary arrangements to maintain the value of the dollar, and hence, the buying power of American consumers.19\"\n\n---------\n\n\"From a longer-term perspective, China’s behavior isn’t puzzling at all. In fact, it’s quite true to form. The unique thing about the Chinese empire is that it has, since the Han dynasty at least, adopted a peculiar sort of tribute system whereby, in exchange for recognition of the Chinese emperor as world-sovereign, they have been willing to shower their client states with gifts far greater than they receive in return.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is every reason to believe that, from China’s point of view, this is the first stage of a very long process of reducing the United States to something like a traditional Chinese client state. And, of course, Chinese rulers are not, any more than the rulers of any other empire, motivated primarily by benevolence. There is always a political cost, and what that headline marked was the first glimmerings of what that cost might ultimately be.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the white working class of the North Atlantic countries, from the United States to West Germany, were offered a deal. If they agreed to set aside any fantasies of fundamentally changing the nature of the system, then they would be allowed to keep their unions, enjoy a wide variety of social benefits (pensions, vacations, health care …), and, perhaps most important, through generously funded and ever-expanding public educational institutions, know that their children had a reasonable chance of leaving the working class entirely.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One key element in all this was a tacit guarantee that increases in workers’ productivity would be met by increases in wages: a guarantee that held good until the late 1970s. Largely as a result, the period saw both rapidly rising productivity and rapidly rising incomes, laying the basis for the consumer economy of today.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Economists call this the “Keynesian era,” since it was a time in which John Maynard Keynes’ economic theories, which already formed the basis of Roosevelt’s New Deal in the United States, were adopted by industrial democracies pretty much everywhere.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Keynes fully accepted that banks do, indeed, create money “out of thin air,” and that for this reason, there was no intrinsic reason that government policy should not encourage this during economic downturns as a way of stimulating demand—a position that had long been dear to the heart of debtors and anathema to creditors.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Certainly, when both Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the UK launched a systematic attack on the power of labor unions, as well as on the legacy of Keynes, it was a way of explicitly declaring that all previous deals were off.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This was accompanied, at first, by a return to “monetarism”: the doctrine that even though money was no longer in any way based in gold, or in any other commodity, government and central-bank policy should be primarily concerned with carefully controlling the money supply to ensure that it acted as if it were a scarce commodity.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the new dispensation, wages would no longer rise, but workers were encouraged to buy a piece of capitalism. Rather than euthanize the rentiers, everyone could now become rentiers—effectively, could grab a chunk of the profits created by their own increasingly dramatic rates of exploitation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One of the guiding principles of Thatcherism and Reaganism alike was that economic reforms would never gain widespread support unless ordinary working people could at least aspire to owning their own homes; to this was added, by the 1990s and 2000s, endless mortgage-refinancing schemes that treated houses, whose value it was assumed would only rise, “like ATMs,”—as the popular catchphrase had it—though it turns out, in retrospect, it was really more like credit cards.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Just as the United States had managed to largely get rid of the problem of political corruption by making the bribery of legislators effectively legal (it was redefined as “lobbying”), so the problem of loan-sharking was brushed aside by making real interest rates of 25 percent, 50 percent, or even in some cases (for instance, for payday loans) 120 percent annually, once typical only of organized crime, perfectly legal—and therefore, enforceable no longer by just hired goons and the sort of people who place mutilated animals on their victims’ doorsteps, but by judges, lawyers, bailiffs, and police.25\"\n\n---------\n\n\"finance” to the “financialization of everyday life.”26 Outside the United States, it came to be known as “neoliberalism.” As an ideology, it meant that not just the market, but capitalism (I must continually remind the reader that these are not the same thing) became the organizing principle of almost everything.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The credit crisis has provided us with a vivid illustration of the principle set out in the last chapter: that capitalism cannot really operate in a world where people believe it will be around forever.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For most of the last several centuries, most people assumed that credit could not be generated infinitely because they assumed that the economic system itself was unlikely to endure forever. The future was likely to be fundamentally different. Yet, somehow, the anticipated revolutions never happened.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There is very good reason to believe that, in a generation or so, capitalism itself will no longer exist—most obviously, as ecologists keep reminding us, because it’s impossible to maintain an engine of perpetual growth forever on a finite planet, and the current form of capitalism doesn’t seem to be capable of generating the kind of vast technological breakthroughs and mobilizations that would be required for us to start finding and colonizing any other planets.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"there seems to have been a profound contradiction between the political imperative of establishing capitalism as the only possible way to manage anything, and capitalism’s own unacknowledged need to limit its future horizons, lest speculation, predictably, go haywire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the last time we shifted from a bullion economy to one of virtual credit money, at the end of the Axial Age and the beginning of the Middle Ages, the immediate shift was experienced largely as a series of great catastrophes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If this book has shown anything, it’s exactly how much violence it has taken, over the course of human history, to bring us to a situation where it’s even possible to imagine that that’s what life is really about.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"historically, impersonal, commercial markets originate in theft. More than anything else, the endless recitation of the myth of barter, employed much like an incantation, is the economists’ way of exorcising it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"That giant debt machine that has, for the last five centuries, reduced increasing proportions of the world’s population to the moral equivalent of conquistadors would appear to be coming up against its social and ecological limits.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"I would like, then, to end by putting in a good word for the non-industrious poor.41 At least they aren’t hurting anyone. Insofar as the time they are taking off from work is being spent with friends and family, enjoying and caring for those they love, they’re probably improving the world more than we acknowledge. Maybe we should think of them as pioneers of a new economic order that would not share our current one’s penchant for self-annihilation.\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/9bd72fae-2ce2-437b-bc45-84d0dcc2837f.html","relUrl":"notes/9bd72fae-2ce2-437b-bc45-84d0dcc2837f.html"},{"doc":"Death's End","title":"Death's End","hpath":"kindle_highlights.deaths_end","content":"\n\"The presumption of innocence does not apply to crimes against humanity.

Shandong (‘Mountain-east’, once spelled ‘Shantung’) is therefore the province with a rugged peninsula below Beijing.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The five imperial dynasties that lasted longest – each for three to four centuries – constitute the great plateaux of Chinese history and are well worth memorising. Cross-reference to contemporary empires elsewhere may help. They are: HAN (Former and Later), 202 BC–AD 220, coeval with the Roman republic and early empire TANG, 618–907, coeval with the expansion of Arab empire SONG (Northern and Southern), 960–1279, coeval with the Crusades MING, 1368–1644, coeval with the early Ottoman and Mughal empires QING (or Manchu), 1644–1912, coeval with Europe’s global expansion.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Ironically the one that most nearly approached the Chinese imperial boast of ruling ‘All under Heaven’ was not Chinese at all but Mongol. This was the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), under one of whose emperors the Venetian Marco Polo supposedly found employ.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"because Chinese characters are not made up of individual letters and so are not alphabetical, their rendition into scripts that use letters (alphabetical scripts) has always been fraught.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A recent authority has calculated that, for an English-speaker, learning to speak Chinese is twenty per cent more difficult than learning to speak French; on the other hand, learning to read and write Chinese is five hundred per cent more difficult than learning to read and write French.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though no amount of provocation can excuse the recent oppression of, for instance, Tibet, it is a matter of record that the Chinese people have suffered far more militarily from outsiders, and been obliged to stomach far more culturally and economically from them, than outsiders ever have from China.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Here a named ‘emperor’ is credited with having separated Heaven and Earth by commanding an end to all unauthorised communication between the two. The link was duly severed by a couple of gods who were in his service. There was to be, as he put it, ‘no more ascending and descending’; and ‘after this was done’, we are told, ‘order was restored and the people returned to virtue’. The ‘emperor’ in question was Zhuan Xu, the second of the mythical ‘Five Emperors’ whom tradition places at the apex of China’s great family tree of legitimate sovereigns.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Of the five, the first was the revered ‘Yellow Emperor’; Zhuan Xu was second; the third and fourth were the much-cited Yao and Shun; and the last was Yu. Unlike his precursors, each of whom had deferred to a successor who was not his own son, Yu yielded to the principle of hereditary succession, named his son as his heir, and so founded China’s first recognised dynasty, the Xia.5\"\n\n---------\n\n\"bronze came to occupy much the same position in ancient China as stone in the contemporary civilisation of Egypt or, later, those of Iran (Persia) and Greece. Enormous effort was devoted to producing bronze-ware, highly sophisticated ideas were expressed through it, some of the earliest inscriptions are found on it, and its durability has ensured that plentiful examples have survived.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The bronze record thus suggests that in the fifteenth to thirteenth centuries BC ‘a state’ in the north’s Central Plain with a highly sophisticated culture expanded its influence over a large part of the region immediately to its south and east.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Only sparingly were metals used for weapons and scarcely at all for tools or agricultural implements. Bronze-casting was the prestige monopoly of a demanding elite. The bulk of all production went to the manufacture of the vessels required for ritual purposes by this elite; and to judge by their find-sites, many of these vessels were ultimately or specifically destined to accompany deceased members of the elite to their graves.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Sixteen skeletons were also found in the tomb. They were distributed within, around and above the coffin. The Shang elite did not like its members to leave this world alone; relatives, retainers, guards, servants and pets accompanied them as part of the grave offering. Ritual demanded, and spectacle no doubt encouraged, human sacrifice on a grand scale. In the larger tombs the victims have been counted in their hundreds. Some skeletons are complete, others dismembered or decapitated, the cranium often having been sawn off, perhaps for bone carving. Some of the mutilated victims may have been convicts or captives taken in war.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Malnutrition has been noted in many skeletons. Leisure must have been rare, insubordination fatal. Cultural excellence came at a price in Bronze Age China; the bright burnish of civilisation was down to the hard rub of despotic power.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘The Tarim Mummies’ (Tarim being the name of the river that once drained the now waterless Tarim basin of eastern Xinjiang) are mostly not of Mongoloid race but of now DNA-certified Caucasoid or Europoid descent. Some had brown hair; at least one stood 2 metres (6.5 feet) tall. They are similar to the Cro-Magnon peoples of eastern Europe. So are their clothes and so probably was their language. It is thought to have been ‘proto-Tocharian’, an early branch of the great Indo-European language family that includes the Celtic, Germanic, Greek and Latin tongues as well as Sanskrit and Early Iranian.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Several hundred mummies have now been discovered, their preservation being the result of the region’s extreme aridity and the high alkaline content of the desert sands. The graves span a long period, from c. 2000 BC to AD 300, but the forebears of their inmates are thought most probably to have migrated from the Altai region to the north, where there flourished around 2000 BC another Europoid culture, that of Afanasevo.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Xinjiang separatists’ – who would prefer to be called ‘Uighur nationalists’ – were reported to have readily adopted Mair’s findings in order to contest Beijing’s claim that their province was historically part of China and so bolster their own claim to autonomy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the Shang elite was indeed literate and that the Chinese script of today is unique in being the direct descendant of one used in the second millennium BC.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The late Shang polity is usually described as ‘a segmentary state’, meaning that those under its direct rule were few while those under its outlying subordinates could be many. Subordinates and allies were usually joined to the Shang lineage by ties of kinship; they were the sons or brothers of kings, or descendants of such. They upheld Shang ritual observance and were in turn upheld by it. They revered the same divine-cum-ancestral host, followed the same mortuary customs and doubtless used the same script and calendar.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is remarkable enough that over three thousand years ago the Shang used a script that is recognisably Chinese today;\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Zhou, despite – or possibly because of – their tolerance of a ‘feudal’ federalism, were reckoned virtuous; and the Qin, with their aggressive centralism, were not.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There, in c. 1035 BC after seven years as de facto regent, the wily Duke of Zhou stepped down from his management of affairs, declined to return to the ancestral capital in the west, and handed back the reins of power to the legitimate ruler, King Cheng. This act would be seen as one of magnificent abnegation and is that for which the Duke is most revered. Having steered the Zhou through their greatest crisis, presided over the creation of the kingdom, and largely formulated its heavenly rationale, the Duke could rather easily have usurped the throne. That he did not was convincing proof of superior virtue and would win him a reputation that almost eclipsed that of Kings Wen, Wu and Cheng.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in The Analects, or ‘Sayings’, of Confucius the ageing philosopher is reported to have sighed: ‘How I have gone downhill! It has been such a long time since I dreamt of the Duke of Zhou.’6\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the inscribed bronzes were apparently doubling as archival records, like the Shang’s oracle bones, and being collected, displayed and hoarded as prestigious family heirlooms. But since they recorded royal favours, those who cherished them, and who in some cases had actually had them cast, were not their royal donors but their recipients, some of comparatively humble origin. The Zhou, in other words, were broadening their base of support while enhancing their own precedence.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in 246 BC, there succeeded to the Qin throne a thirteen-year-old boy ‘with arched nose and long eyes, the puffed out chest of a hawk, the voice of a jackal…and the heart of a tiger or a wolf’. At this stage he was known as King Zheng of Qin.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Li Bing’s Dujiangyan system of weirs and races was extremely ambitious. The labour requirement can only be guessed at, but both deep-cutting and hill-contouring were involved, plus some bridge-building and an elaborate distribution network. ‘The largest, most carefully planned public works project yet seen anywhere on the eastern half of the Eurasian continent’, it reduced the danger of floods, provided a commercial waterway, and in time converted central Sichuan into the great rice-bowl of inland China.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If China had its own ‘seven wonders of the ancient world’, Li Bing’s waterworks would be one of them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Courtesy of what amounted to an interstate food chain, matters had been getting slightly simpler. Wu had been devoured by Yue in the early fifth century BC, and then Yue (including Wu) had been overrun by Chu in the late fourth century BC. Naturally if Chu (now including Yue and Wu) were to succumb to Qin, the entire Yangzi valley, including its far-reaching feeders such as the Han River, would be united. Qin would be practically invincible, two-thirds of ‘core’ China would be under its rule\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Seizing the moment, in 280–277 BC Qin hit back with a pincer movement involving two amphibious advances, one down the Han valley and the other down the Yangzi. The first struck deep into Hubei province and captured both the Chu capital and the ancestral tombs of its kings. The second ended Chu influence in Ba and secured the Yangzi down to below its famous gorges. Chu never recovered from these twin disasters. The loss of territory was severe, and the subsequent drift of Chu’s domain towards the coast and Shandong should be seen as less in the nature of compensation, more of dissipation. Worse was the loss of prestige and legitimacy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Another telling preliminary to the First Emperor’s personal reign was his announcement, immediately after assuming the imperial title, that Qin ‘ruled by the power of water’. This was a reference not to the success of Li Bing’s Sichuan sluices but to the ‘Five Phases’ (or sometimes ‘Five Powers’ or ‘Five Elements’), whose sequential ascendancy supposedly controlled the course of history. While Confucians attributed a dynasty’s power to Heaven’s Mandate, others of a less orthodox (or more Daoist) persuasion attributed it to one of the five elemental Phases/Elements – earth, wood, metal, fire and water.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"did not exactly dispel the idea of a ferocious justice. Under some circumstances the theft of a single coin could result in the amputation of a foot, plus tattooing of the torso (a particularly degrading form of disfigurement) and hard labour. But straight fines or short spells of unpaid corvée service appear to have been the more usual punishments; and whatever the case, justice was anything but arbitrary. The nature of the offence, the degree of intent, any extenuating circumstances, and the bureaucratic procedures to be observed throughout the legal process, were minutely addressed even for misdemeanours of little apparent consequence.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the emphasis was on ‘efficiency, precision, and fixed routine in administrative procedure…[plus] exact quantification of data, and attention to the improvement of agricultural production and conserving of natural resources’.13 Households were registered for taxation purposes, and the population organised into grouped families for military and civil conscription.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The First Emperor’s introduction of what came to be known as the ‘Small Seal’ script was designed to counter all such diversity. It involved eradicating obsolete or offensive characters, simplifying and rationalising others, and standardising each and every one. Although destined for an early and more lasting revision by Han scholars, ‘Small Seal’ script established the principle of a written language that was common to the literate elite throughout the empire regardless of spoken dialects, and which was recognised as the medium of both government and scholarship. It was a principle of incalculable significance. Regional distinctions were thereby subsumed, although social distinctions, particularly as between the lettered classes and the unlettered, were engrained. Without this standardisation China’s bureaucrats would today need as many interpreters as the European Union;\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The merit of the August Emperor lies in diligently fostering basic concerns, exalting agriculture, abolishing lesser occupations, so the black-headed people may be rich.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For though his reformation of the script was welcomed by the literate, the First Emperor showed nothing but contempt for traditional scholarship. History was there to be made, he seemed to say, not to be repeated. To those who prattled about the grand old Duke of Zhou and Heaven’s Mandate, he extended neither respect nor favour; and when they continued to snipe at the legalist emphasis on law rather than precedent, and on a ruler’s strength rather than his virtue, the literary pogrom of 213 BC was his typically unequivocal response.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the idea in 213 BC was not to abolish history and literature but to restrict access to them and so, as the Shiji puts it, ‘to make the common people ignorant and to see to it that no one in the empire used the past to criticise the present’.18 Yet the result was exactly the opposite: for in an effort to make good the supposed losses, Han scholars would scrutinise what survived even more intently.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Walls certainly got a bad name; so did Meng Tian and the First Emperor as those responsible for the most notorious example. But of late, scholarship has been chary of such deductions. It is more inclined to demolish the whole concept of a ‘Great Wall’ and to diminish the scale and significance of Qin’s pioneering effort.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 210 BC the First Emperor was still in his forties and apparently fit enough to undertake another tour of his domains. Only days before his collapse he was out shooting sea monsters on the Shandong shore. The suggestion that he was a victim of poisoning therefore seems plausible. But if this was the case, the dose was probably self-administered; for in the potions prepared for him by the experts in immortality the vital ingredient was cinnabar. A mineral rarity, cinnabar came largely from Sichuan and was used as a pigment, most notably to impart a ruddy shade of vermilion to the ink reserved for emperors. As a crystalline form of mercuric sulphide, it is also toxic, and when ingested in quantity, fatal. Gulping down the draughts that promised eternal life, the First Emperor may have been inviting a rather sudden death.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On regaining the capital, the plotters swung into action. Prince Huhai was proclaimed the emperor’s designated heir and installed as the Qin Second Emperor. The First Emperor’s preferred heir was then charged with treason and, in forged orders from his father, commanded to commit suicide – which, being a truly filial son, he did. Then the Meng brothers were censured for opposing these arrangements and detained until such time as Meng Yi could be executed and Meng Tian obliged to take poison.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Make the laws sterner and the penalties more severe,’ urged Zhao Gao. ‘See that those charged with a crime implicate others and that punishments extend to the families of the criminals. Wipe out the chief ministers and sow dissension among their kin.’ With the scheming eunuch acting as grand inquisitor, twelve princes and ten princesses were dismembered in the Xianyang marketplace. Those implicated with them together with their ‘three degrees of relatives’ – traditionally parents, siblings and offspring – suffered a similar fate but were ‘too numerous even to be counted’. New laws and harsher punishments were promulgated. Taxes and levies were increased, and yet more forced labour was marched off to work and die on still-incomplete projects such as the Opang Palace and the northern frontier’s walls. ‘Each man began to fear for his own safety,’ says Sima Qian, ‘and those who longed to revolt were many.’3\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Rebellion in fact broke out within six months of the First Emperor’s death.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Grand Diviner then confirmed that there had of late been some liturgical shortcomings in the imperial performance of the ancestral rites. The Second Emperor was advised to withdraw from public life to fast and purify himself. While thus secluded, a hostile force invaded his place of retreat. Zhao Gao declared it to be the advance guard of a rebel army (it was of course nothing of the sort, just his own carefully drilled cohorts) and advised the young emperor to pre-empt capture and execution by taking poison. After further prompting and not a little threatening, the emperor obliged. Zhao Gao himself then seized the imperial seals. This, however, was too much for the other officials and much too much for Heaven, which made its feelings felt with three hefty earth tremors. Zhao Gao therefore turned to a grandson of the First Emperor, who, though reluctant to accept the throne, did the next best thing: he had Zhao Gao murdered. By now it was 207 BC, only three years since the First Emperor’s death but long enough for his entire empire to be up in arms.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To be fair, it is doubtful whether Qin ever really laid claim to such a thing. The First Emperor’s inscriptions scarcely mention Heaven, let alone the Mandate; and if they were drafted by such a rabid legalist as Li Si, this is hardly surprising. But in Confucian terms, legitimacy now lay firmly with the anti-Qin forces and would continue to do so throughout the next seven years of civil war.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Han empire that resulted would enshrine features of Chinese culture that would be revered ever after and lend compelling substance to the idea of a continuous civilisation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Resistance to Qin rule proved to be not just popular but populist. In his determination to mobilise the manpower of the empire, the First Emperor had established a direct relationship between the centralised government and the localised governed. Wrenched from mass oblivion, the black-haired commoners had been dragooned into participating in the historical process. Millions had been uprooted to fight, labour or colonise on the empire’s behalf. Millions more had been obliged to support this effort through heavy taxation and collective liability backed by ferocious penalties. Their woes were shared and their fears real. While nationalists would later applaud the First Emperor’s efforts at unification, and while Maoists would approve his autocratic efforts in mass mobilisation, orthodox Marxists would be more gratified by the anti-Qin response and its early evidence of peasant revolt and class consciousness.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A new breed of leader now emerged, the foremost example being Xiang Yu. Another native of Chu but an aristocrat rather than a commoner, descended from a long line of Chu generals, Xiang Yu towered above his contemporaries in both physique and accomplishment. He was foul of temper but fearless in battle, and his men worshipped him. Though historians nurtured in the literary and bureaucratic tradition found nothing remotely romantic in battlefield antics, Xiang Yu would prove an exception. Sima Qian called him arrogant, deceitful and ungrateful, yet could neither disguise his admiration nor resist the sort of detail calculated to enhance a heroic reputation. Xiang Yu strides from the pages of the Shiji like no other warrior; and it is testimony to the Shiji’s influence that he is still sometimes hailed as the most accomplished general in the whole of Chinese history.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Heaven of its own volition showered the young Liu Bang with auspicious signs and lucky encounters. Dragons – of all animals the most closely associated with power and celestial favour – featured in many of these manifestations. His mother had conceived him by a dragon, another hovered over him when he slept, and his well-whiskered features were sufficiently dragon-like to excite physiognomists (they foretold your future from your face), one of whom, a certain Lü, was so impressed that he gave him his daughter in marriage. Thus does the Grand Historian waste no time in flagging the future founder of the Han dynasty and his influential consort.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 207 BC, the year in which the Second Emperor committed suicide and Zhao Gao was murdered, the armies of the now commander-in-chief Xiang Yu inflicted a succession of heavy defeats on the Qin forces, driving them back to the hill passes that guarded the Qin stronghold along the Wei River. ‘The war-cry of Chu shook the heavens, and the men of the other armies all trembled with fear,’ says Sima Qian.8\"\n\n---------\n\n\"From this 206 BC appointment of Liu Bang of Pei as king of Han, the Han dynasty would date its foundation and take its name; but it would be another four years of strife and appalling bloodshed before the Han king became the Han emperor. For no sooner had Xiang Yu marched east than Liu Bang marched north again, replacing the mountain road and retaking the Qin heartland.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To this day, Chinese chessboards often indicate that one end is for ‘Han’ rather than ‘black’ and the other for ‘Chu’ rather than ‘white’.9 The rules of combat, such as they were, were mutually understood; move by move the game must progress until a king was toppled. But the odds were evenly stacked, and though fortunes would fluctuate, the outcome remained uncertain till the bitter end.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It was Heaven which was destroying him, said Xiang Yu, and ‘no fault of my own in the use of arms’. On the Yangzi – it was just west of Nanjing – a boat was waiting. Safety beckoned. It was from across the river in erstwhile Wu that he had set forth eight years earlier. He still had supporters there; he could yet rule there. But ‘how can I face them again?’ he asked. ‘How could I not feel shame in my heart?’ So saying, he dismounted, and presenting ‘Dapple’ to the kindly boatman, turned back and strode on foot towards the Han host. In the final scuffle Xiang Yu killed ‘several hundred’, according to Sima Qian, while suffering ‘a dozen wounds’. Faint and bleeding, he then recognised an old acquaintance who was now a Han cavalry officer. His last words were spoken soldier to soldier. ‘I have heard that Han has offered a reward of a thousand catties11 of gold and a fief of ten thousand households for my life,’ said Xiang Yu. ‘So I will do you a favour!’ And with that he cut his own throat and died.12\"\n\n---------\n\n\"History would adopt this title exclusively, commemorating him as Han Gaozu, ‘the Han Great Progenitor’ (or sometimes Han Gaodi, ‘the Han Progenitor-Emperor’). The first commoner to rise to the dizzy heights of emperor, he would be the last for 1,500 years. Founding a dynasty from such obscurity was no small achievement, and the Grand Historian, writing at a time when the strongest of all the Han emperors occupied the throne, acknowledged a remarkable lineage by hailing its imperial progenitor.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A long reign would have helped, but Han Gaozu lived only seven more years (202–195 BC), most of these being spent suppressing rebellions and fending off incursions. Helpful too would have been a strong successor; instead he was followed by a timid teenager (who was at least his son), then two infants (who were probably not his grandsons). Falling an early prey to the palace intrigues that attended every minority, by 190 BC Han authority was being wielded, and the throne effectively usurped, by the Dowager Empress Lü, Gaozu’s bride from the days when he was a nonentity in Pei. Qin’s imperial phase had lasted a paltry fifteen years; Han’s looked likely to last only slightly longer.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Sima Qian’s Shiji treats of the Dowager Empress Lü in its section on ‘Rulers’, as if it was she who was Gaozu’s successor, while Huidi (‘Emperor Hui’, the di suffix signifying ‘emperor’) gets no separate treatment, just occasional mentions. From Gaozu’s death in 195 BC until her own death in 180 BC, the dowager empress most emphatically ruled while emperors barely reigned. Huidi’s only achievement was to encourage Shusun Tong, the dynasty’s expert on ceremonial and ritual, in the elaboration of a Han dynastic mystique.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Gaozu was so contemptuous of formal erudition that he was known to snatch off the cap of the nearest scholar to use as a chamber pot. Yet while informality was all very well in reaction to Qin sobriety, even the emperor was irked when drinking companions burst in on his lovemaking. What was needed, said Shusun Tong, were rules of protocol and court ritual. The emperor somewhat doubtfully agreed. ‘See what you can do, but make it easy to learn…it must be the sort of thing I can manage.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The legalist framework of government – registration and rankings, group responsibility, a tariff of punishments and rewards, universal taxation, corvée and conscription – was retained in toto; and though somewhat relaxed in practice, it would remain fundamental to Chinese empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Gaozu’s efforts concentrated on a change of personnel. Erstwhile generals and other potential challengers were gradually replaced as kings by less bellicose members of his own family. Empress Lü continued the process by installing members of her own family. Wendi, in replacing them, took the opportunity to break up some kingdoms and reclaim others. The 154 BC revolt suppressed by Jingdi provided a further opportunity for undermining the kingdoms. All of this forestalled a relapse into the chaos of the ‘Warring States’ era, although so long as kingdoms rejoicing in illustrious names like Qi, Zhao, Yan and even Chu survived, the integrity of the empire remained compromised.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This was Zhao Tuo, otherwise King Wu of Nanyue. For ten years he was left in peace, Han Gaozu ‘having enough to do to take care of internal troubles’, according to Sima Qian. But in 196 BC the Han emperor sent a trusty troubleshooter, the Confucian ideologue Lu Jia, to talk King Wu into acknowledging Han supremacy. The king obliged in return for recognition of his assumed title, then reneged over a trade dispute. A Han embargo on iron sales, a strategic commodity since it was used for weapons, brought protests, followed by recrimination: King Wu declared himself an emperor, and troops sent south in 183 BC by the Dowager Empress Lü failed to quash this presumption. On the contrary, Nanyue’s troops began overrunning neighbouring territories. Their sovereign now rode in a carriage with a yellow canopy and issued his own ‘edicts’, both of these being imperial prerogatives.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Han empire, which had just opened a grand salient into central Asia, was being humbled by ‘barbarians’ at its back door. Han Wudi could no longer trifle with the situation, and suasion having failed, only force remained. In 112 BC no less than four expeditions converged on Panyu by river and sea. The ‘General of the Towered Ships’ at the head of 20,000–30,000 men got there first. Joined by the ‘General Who Calms the Waves’, he stormed Panyu at night and, come dawn, the city surrendered. ‘Thus five generations, or ninety-three years after Zhao Tuo first became king of Southern Yue, the state was destroyed.’18 Sima Qian, then at work on his Shiji, felt nothing but satisfaction. There would be no more kings of Southern Yue, nor of Eastern Yue (in Fujian), which suffered a similar fate the following year. By the end of 111 BC all of mainland southern China plus the island of Hainan and the Red River valley of northern Vietnam were finally incorporated into the empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Wudi succeeded Han Jingdi in 141 BC. Fifteen at the time, he was still on the throne when he died at the age of sixty-eight. One of the longest and most eventful reigns on record (141–87 BC) benefited greatly from continuity, then fell victim to it. Opinion of Wudi’s rule has always been divided. He was either ‘an outright autocrat’ who subverted the authority of his ministers to ‘direct the government in person’, and so become ‘perhaps the most famous of all Chinese emperors’; or he was a palace cipher, scarcely able to control his own household, who ‘took no part in the military campaigns for which his reign is famous’ and was so oblivious of their cost that his tenure was in fact ‘a calamity for China’.1\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The sage ruler ‘does nothing (wuwei)’, says Laozi, ‘and there is nothing that is not brought to order’.2 This was possible because in an ideal world the moral example set by the emperor was thought to create an attractional effect, like a magnet. By it, society as a whole was automatically orientated on the path of righteousness, so eliminating the need for laws and punishments,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Han Wudi increased the frequency of these recruitment drives, while standardising the selection process by the introduction of a question-and-answer element. Qualification by examination, a cardinal feature of the later imperial bureaucracy, would follow. Even a questionnaire required a syllabus and a panel to mark the submissions. The panel was set up as an academy of scholars, of whom there were fifty in 136 BC, though the number soon increased; and the syllabus entailed these academicians selecting and interpreting a canon of suitable texts, initially five, all of them either favoured by Confucius\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Han resentment grew proportionately. It had peaked in 192 BC when a communication from Shanyu Maodun to the Dowager Empress Lü mischievously suggested that, since both had been widowed and were of a certain age, they might find agreeable consolation in one another’s company. This was too much for the dowager empress, who was all for calling out the army. Cooler counsels prevailed, however; indeed, the final response from one of a normally vain and vindictive disposition plumbs the depths of abasement: My age is advanced and my vitality is diminished [wrote the dowager empress]. Both my hair and teeth are falling out, and I cannot even walk steadily. The shanyu must have heard exaggerated reports [of me]. I am not worthy of his lowering himself. But my country has done nothing wrong, and I hope that he will spare it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For the Han policy of making the Xiongnu reliant on Chinese produce was paying off. In subsequent negotiations, access to the markets that had sprung up along the frontier is mentioned among the Xiongnu demands as often as tribute, and its refusal would become highly provocative.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This prompted a suggestion, credited to the teenage Wudi, for a Han envoy-explorer to try to make contact with the Yuezhi and sound them out about an anti-Xiongnu alliance. A palace official called Zhang Qian volunteered for the task and in c. 138 BC, accompanied by a servant who was good at bringing down game, plus a small military escort, this explorer Zhang disappeared into the desert sunset. He was soon intercepted and taken captive by the shanyu’s troops. How would the emperor feel, asked the shanyu, if the Xiongnu sent emissaries traipsing across China to open diplomatic relations with Nanyue? The mission was an affront to Xiongnu sovereignty and Zhang was to be detained by them indefinitely. He would in fact escape, but not until ten years later. Resuming his journey, explorer Zhang then vanished into the unknown a second time. He had probably been completely forgotten when in 126 BC, thirteen years older, geographically wiser than any contemporary and lately escaped from yet another spell in Xiongnu captivity, he and his huntsman-companion came trotting back into Chang’an. By then Han–Xiongnu relations had plummeted into all-out war. Nothing would be more timely than central Asian intelligence from an intrepid traveller who deserves recognition as both the pioneer of the ‘Silk Road’ and the first to play the ‘Great Game’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For according to explorer Zhang, Han China was not alone in the world: out there, there were other ‘great states’, as he called them. Their people lived in cities; and they too ‘kept records by writing’, an extraordinary revelation. They ‘made their living in much the same way as the Chinese’; and shockingly, they were quite unaware that zhongguo, now taken to mean ‘the Middle Kingdom’, was anywhere near the middle.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the kingdom of ‘Shendu’ was of more interest. While exploring the Bactrian bazaars, Zhang had noticed ‘cloth from Shu [Sichuan] and bamboo canes from Qiong [also in Sichuan]’, both of which were said to have been imported via ‘Shendu’. Although some of explorer Zhang’s place-names are hard to identify, there is no question that ‘Shendu’ was India; its inhabitants ‘rode elephants into battle’ and even the Romans knew the country as ‘Sindu’ (after the Sind, or Indus, River). Since it was said to be several thousand kilometres east of Bactria, Zhang reasoned that it must ‘not be very far away from Shu’. Silk cloth and bamboo canes must therefore be reaching India direct from China’s extreme south-west.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All the last three administrative units were manned by salaried officials who had been chosen on merit and posted from outside to avoid any local conflict of interest. Their functions were not simply extractive. Besides being responsible for registration and judicial duties, they organised relief and public works (roads, bridges, dams, granaries), regulated local markets and manufactories, and oversaw public order and security. Of the revenue they collected through taxation, whether in coin or kind, only part was remitted annually to the central government, the rest being retained for local expenditure.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"retrenchment was the order of the day. Han troops would never again tramp across the high Pamirs into central Asia, nor take for granted Vietnam, whose first of many ‘wars of independence’ was about to erupt. In Chang’an the great public spectacles of Han Wudi’s reign – military parades, tribute receptions and athletic meetings like those of Qin – had been either scaled down or abolished. Imperial hunting grounds were being neglected; stables stood empty as the emperor’s equestrian establishment was halved. Hundreds of musicians and dancers had been dismissed as surplus to ritual requirement. The textile workshops in Shandong that had supplied the court with robes and furnishings had been shut down completely.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The august Octavian, who was making administrative reform his own priority, would have despaired had he had any inkling of the intricate checks and balances of the Han bureaucratic apparatus.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘fires, comets, eclipses, fogs, flies, droughts, floods, earthquakes, avalanches, murders, meteors, and thunders dot the pages of the [Hanshu’s] chapter [on Chengdi], few years being without several such visitations’.1 Not even the reviled Qin First and Second Emperors had been quite so afflicted with ill omens. Dynastic change was in the stars, on the breeze and underfoot.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"it was that, after a decent interval full of encouraging memorials, on 10 January AD 9 at the tomb-temple of Han Gaozu, and with the blessing of the now eighty-something Grand Dowager Empress Wang, Wang Mang formally ‘accepted the resignation’ of the Han and was entrusted with the imperial seals. Little Ruzi was returned to the nursery none the worse for his two years as heir apparent,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It is fixed that the title [of my dynasty] in possessing the empire shall be Xin.2\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Practically everything that is known of Wang Mang’s reign comes from the Hanshu. None of it is favourable, and nor could it be; for Wang Mang had to be discredited in the historical record. His overthrow in AD 23, the restoration of the Han in AD 25 and the two more centuries of Han rule that would follow meant that he could be portrayed only as a usurping impostor.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"On page after page he is caricatured as an unctuous and manipulative hypocrite whose vanity and indecision were as disastrous for the empire as they were for himself. Parsimonious or extravagant, indulgent or vindictive, aggressive or conciliatory, his every action is seen purely in personal terms and condemned as a failure of character. The Ban family, who compiled the Hanshu, had good reasons of their own for bad-mouthing Wang Mang: he had dismissed one of them from office, and they were writing under the restored Han, to whom the Bans were indebted and Wang Mang was anathema.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In a flurry of directives, slavery (though never that common) was abolished, the sale of land was forbidden, orders were issued for the break-up and redistribution of large estates, and there was a move towards the restoration of the Zhou’s idealised ‘well-field’ system of peasant landholdings (whereby eight families each held an equal area of land within a ditched grid, somewhat like a boxed ‘noughts-and-crosses’ graph, the spare square in the middle being held in common). These were brave initiatives aimed at redressing inequality\"\n\n---------\n\n\"his economic policies were potentially catastrophic. His four reformations of the coinage (including the reintroduction of archaic currencies such as ‘spade-money’ and cowrie shells), his ‘Five Equalisations’ (designed to stabilise prices and provide rural credit) and his ‘Six Monopolies’ (forest produce was added to the usual list of iron, salt, liquor, etc.) may have been well intentioned. Although state monopolies had been a Confucian target in the Discourses on Salt and Iron, all these measures could be seen as discouraging speculative enterprise in favour of honest small-scale farming, the bedrock of Confucian economics. But in practice they caused chaos and distress. Most were swiftly adjusted or rescinded, though not before corrupt officials, hoarders and counterfeiters had had a field day.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"First there was a plague of locusts along the Yellow River. It was nothing unusual. A bounty was offered to locust hunters, so many cash (the basic copper coin) per pound being paid out for squashed insects just as, in the no less lowering times of Chairman Mao’s ‘Great Leap Forward’, a few fen per dead sparrow would be offered to conserve grain stocks and stave off famine. Seemingly there is nothing quite like impending catastrophe to bring out the esteem in which autocrats hold the death-defying capabilities of the masses. Then came the flood.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"An alternative reading of the frantic experimentation that characterised the last days of the Xin might suggest that Wang Mang was at his wits’ end. He took to a diet of ale and shellfish, ‘read only military books’, and slept at his writing stool. By the time Chang’an fell to the first peasant army, he was too weak to walk.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A litany of new titles, such as ‘The General-Causing-Great-Waters-to-Run-So-Extinguishing-Any-Fire-that-has-Arisen’, proved ineffective. So did a written appeal ‘in more than a thousand words’ that Wang Mang addressed personally to Heaven and accompanied with heart-rending lamentations.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Chinese language has no personalised noun corresponding to the English word ‘Confucianism’. Ru, the character which is so translated, means something much more general like ‘learned gentility’ or simply ‘dilettante-(ism)’. Lacking the specifics of either a political philosophy, a personal ideology or an organised religion (except insofar as Confucius himself became a cult figure), ‘Confucianism’ is best seen as the text-hallowed brand of learning elaborated by Master Kong and his followers to advance a unique ‘moral perspective’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Destitution being the most compelling of dictators, probably no emperor could have controlled the situation. A form of government devised for a settled agrarian population was in deep trouble the moment villagers turned vagrants and farmers took to brigandage. With the fields obliterated and the registered householders no longer at home, the revenue failed and the corvée collapsed. Central authority was itself undermined. It was this dislocation which encouraged a host of contenders for the Mandate in the AD 20s, sustained numerous other rebellions of a more peripheral nature, and encouraged landed clans in the core provinces to exploit the situation by augmenting the size of both their holdings and their followings.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"watershed in more ways than one, Wang Mang’s chaotic reign had divided the Han era in two. Just like the Zhou kings of old, the restored Han of the first century AD would seek to put recent reverses behind them by choosing a new setting for their imperial capital.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In general, the Later Han would prove less adventurous than the Former Han and far more prone to crises. The official histories award them a generous two centuries (AD 25–220); but their first eight decades were characterised by laborious reconstruction, the next eight brought a painful unravelling, and the last four saw them reduced to a pitiful irrelevance. When later writers sang of the glories of Han, they almost invariably had in mind the Former or Western Han, not the Later or Eastern Han.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In defeating his many rivals, Han Guang Wudi displayed an aptitude for military command that was rare among emperors, plus a confidence in his subordinate generals that was almost unprecedented.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Ma marched into Vietnam with overwhelming force, his supplies followed by sea from Guangdong, and the revolt was all over by the end of AD 43. But the written character for ‘Yue’ being read as ‘Viet’ in Vietnamese, and leadership of the Yue having fallen to two wildly courageous sisters (called Zheng in Chinese, Trung in Vietnamese), it was inevitable that later Vietnamese patriots would hail the revolt as the first ‘national uprising’ of an all too often oppressed people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though by no means the end of the Xiongnu people as a frontier presence, the ructions over the shanyu’s succession in AD 46–49 sounded the death-knell of the Xiongnu state. Repeating events of exactly a hundred years earlier, in AD 51 one shanyu claimant finally turned to Luoyang for support and tendered his allegiance, plus a modest tribute.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Yet for the best part of a century substantial missions had been scrambling back and forth, often annually, to pledge fealty on behalf of the Kashmiris and to confer titles on behalf of the emperor. In both directions they also carried merchandise – woollens, embroidery and Indian produce from Kashmir, large consignments of silk from China. Secure in their Himalayan fastness, the Kashmiris brooked no interference in their internal affairs and massacred one Han mission that tried. But apologies had followed, the protestations of loyalty continued, and the exchanges had resumed. Inveterate traders to this day, the Kashmiris were clearly using the Han tributary system and the protection that it afforded to conduct purely commercial activities.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Standard Histories nevertheless tell of emperors so distracted and besotted by their womenfolk that they habitually neglected the call of duty and ignored the plight of the empire. Consorts and dowagers are portrayed as inherently devious and spiteful, devoid of any sense of duty, and largely responsible for the endless intrigues and purges. This was explained in cosmic terms as yin, the passive female principle, being in disastrous ascendancy over yang, its active male opposite or complement. All of which not only reeks of gender prejudice – we know of only one female Han historian – but is open to serious doubt on other grounds.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inevitably it was known as Shu. And thus as Shu, Wu and Wei, the intrepid adversaries of the Red Cliffs, and then their descendants, would continue their three-sided vendetta for control of China for another half-century.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In China no doctrine, revelation or mode of conduct was credited with a monopoly of truth, nor was any accounted complete in itself, for the simple reason that none was that clearly defined. Confucians (ru) had always dabbled in Daoist practices; indeed, in the post-Han period Confucian studies became heavily influenced by both Daoist and Buddhist texts. Daoists in turn usually subscribed to the core Confucian values, while Daoist communities became deeply indebted to Buddhism for such organisational features as a clergy and institutionalised monasticism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Other ideas, such as monastic celibacy and reincarnation, were simply offensive to a society in which procreation was seen as a moral duty and ancestors were cherished as spirits immune from the hazard of rebirth. While Confucianism harped on the individual’s duty to family and state, Buddhism signposted a path to salvation that neatly bypassed both.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In India merchants had derived encouragement from the Buddhist disregard of caste strictures on the freedom of movement; in China the Confucian contempt for traders and commerce in general disposed the mercantile classes towards Buddhism as a respectable alternative. In both countries, the merchant community reciprocated, proving generous benefactors as well as extending hospitality and protection to missionaries.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"More certainly the remarkable fourth-century cave paintings at Kizil (near Kuqa in Xinjiang) mimic those of Ajanta (in Maharashtra on the road to India’s west coast) and include a telling scene of the Buddha lighting the way for a one-man caravan. Produced by the same quasi-fresco technique and probably contemporary, the narrative scenes and interlocking designs at Kizil and Ajanta, though half a continent apart, are thought to be the work of artists who were either from the same school or in possession of a common crib.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Mahayanists deified not only the Buddha himself but a host of other Enlightened Ones, known as Bodhisattva (in Chinese busa), who included Amitabha (‘the Buddha of the Western Paradise’ to the Chinese), Avaloketiswara (who changed sex to become the female ‘Guanyin’ in China) and Maitreya (the Chinese ‘Miluo’, or ‘Future Buddha’).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Everywhere the quality of translations had greatly improved. This was thanks in large part to the labours of Dharmaraksha (c. 230–307). The son of a Yuezhi merchant domiciled in Dunhuang (Gansu), Dharmaraksha had received a Chinese education and, proving a consummate linguist, had undertaken the translation of over 150 Buddhist texts; according to his biographer, ‘he contributed more than anyone else to the conversion of China to Buddhism’.19 Chinese scholars were now alert to a literary and speculative tradition that for its richness and prolixity rivalled their own.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"With the flight of the Jin court and the destruction of Luoyang by the Xiongnu, 500 years of Chinese empire had come to an end. It was one of history’s more emphatic breaks.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But he died before his mainly Xiongnu forces could take Luoyang. The honours fell to his successor, Liu Cong, ‘the Chinese Attila’. Ten thousand defenders are said to have been slaughtered in the final assault, a modest figure by Chinese standards which may reflect earlier desertions. If the descriptions of a city already choked with dead bodies are to be believed, Liu Cong’s incendiarists may even have done it a favour.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To such monsters a doctrine enjoining non-violence and respect for life in all its forms should have been cause for ridicule, tending to rage. Yet it was under the patronage of precisely these Xiongnu tyrants that Buddhism in the north made its most dramatic strides.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Buddha, being a foreign [or outsiders’] god, is the very one we [as outsiders] should worship,’ he declared in the course of an edict urging Buddhist devotion;28 on similar grounds, Buddhism would be encouraged by later incomers such as the Mongols and Manchus. Additionally, its universalist message, extending the chance of release from suffering to all peoples regardless of race, gender or education, was in marked contrast to the narrow social remit of Confucianism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In effect Buddhism offered to semi-literate herdsmen a source of identity and legitimacy denied them by the lofty standards of Confucian scholarship; and by sidelining the precedent-bound rituals of the ru, it brought these alien rulers into direct touch with the less educated mass of their subjects, Chinese and non-Chinese, among whom northern Buddhism now found its greatest following.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As under previous regimes, Buddhism served as a source of legitimisation and as a bridge over the ethnic divide between non-Chinese and Chinese. But it was also harnessed more directly to the interests of the state. A branch of the bureaucracy took over the regulation of Buddhist affairs; and the difficulty of Buddhist clergy owing obedience to their monastic superiors rather than to the imperial authorities was overcome by elevating the emperor above the clergy as a titular Bodhisattva.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The new Luoyang covered an area of over 18 square kilometres (7 square miles) and accommodated more than half a million people and 1,300 monasteries. It witnessed scenes of magnificence barely rivalled by its predecessors, it hosted further developments in Buddhist scholarship, it minted the first new coinage for a couple of centuries – and it lasted for all of a generation. Not wilfully destroyed this time, merely evacuated, by 535 Luoyang was again a ghost town.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Some dynasties lasted long; others barely survived a few turbulent decades – it was as if they had been inserted to fill a hiatus or give a new direction. The Former Han had been preceded by the intrusion that was the First Emperor’s Qin dynasty, and the Later Han by the ‘blip’ that was Wang Mang’s Xin dynasty. A pattern was apparent; and since the succession of dynasties was supposed to mimic the cycles of the planets, some Chinese historians embraced the possibility of ‘intercalary’ dynasties. Thus Qin and Xin could be seen as necessary, if traumatic, correctional preludes that had brought Former Han and Later Han into propitious harmony with the cosmic forces.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"before the Tang dynasty could embark on its long and glorious career, another short and dramatic intercalary prelude would serve to bring the country back into what dynastic historians regarded as its natural trajectory. This was as a unitary empire; and the dynasty responsible was the Sui.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Weapons were supposedly collected, their private manufacture banned and, setting a precedent that would have long-term consequences, all boats of more than 10 metres (33 feet) were confiscated. As well as outlawing local navies, this had the effect of containing mercantile enterprise and ensuring that water transport served the interests of the state.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nearly four thousand temples, pagodas, nunneries and monasteries were founded during Sui Wendi’s reign, many of them in his rebuilt Chang’an, where one pagoda reportedly measured 100 metres (109 yards) in height and 120 metres (131 yards) in girth. The number of new Buddha images erected ran to over a hundred thousand, while those repaired following the Northern Zhou’s iconoclasm exceeded 1.5 million.8 In China there was no nobler exemplar of the Buddhist sovereign as maha-danapati (supreme donor) than Sui Wendi.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But the Standard History of the Sui was written under the direction of their nemesis, the Tang; and while Sui Wendi, as the reunifier, could scarcely be denied his share of praise, Sui Yangdi, as the last of his line, could conveniently be credited with more than his share of opprobrium. Sui Yangdi brought the empire to the brink of ruin; therefore rumours of his having murdered his father (the most heinous crime in an ultra-filial society) and having ravaged his father’s consorts (which was deemed incest) must be true V. C. Xiong, his recent biographer, observes that even the name by which he is remembered, Yang (plus the imperial signifier ‘ –di’), was in fact a posthumous pejorative reserved exclusively for those who ‘lust after beautiful women…abandon ritual…defy Heaven and abuse the people’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Yet Yangdi’s achievements were far from mean and his crimes not dramatically worse than his father’s – or than those of his immediate Tang successors. As commander-in-chief of his father’s southern invasion and then a sympathetic governor of the south, he had played a leading role in his father’s reunification; and when the apprentice became the autocrat, he pursued almost identical policies with equal, if eventually disastrous, zest.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Suffice it to say that in opting for Han precedent in matters of ritual, administration and justice, the Sui launched China’s ‘Second Empire’ as a fair approximation to the highly regulated, bureaucratised and draconian despotism that had characterised its First – and which would remain until its last.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"south, the east and along the northern frontiers. The Sui solution to expanding the base of civil service recruitment was to set up a Board of Civil Office to centralise all appointments and scrutinise the selection process.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The almost stone-free nature of most Chinese architecture goes a long way towards explaining the rapidity with which city after city rose and fell. Completed in 606, Sui Yangdi’s Luoyang had taken little over a year.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This was a canal – or rather it was the many canals and hydraulic features that, connecting numerous rivers, lakes and pre-existing conduits over a total distance of nearly 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles), came to be known as the Grand Canal. Excavated between 605 and 611, the Grand Canal ran north-west from Hangzhou (south of the Yangzi delta) to the Yellow River near Luoyang, with a long extension from there north-east to where Beijing now stands. In effect it linked north and south, east and centre. It was an axial artery for a reunited empire. It was also ‘without doubt, the grandest navigation system ever undertaken by a single sovereign in pre-modern history’.14\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Grand Canal, linking the Yangzi region with its rice surplus to the heavily populated and famine-prone northern plains, thus had a similar effect to the first transcontinental railroads in North America. It made China’s economic integration feasible.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But the cost was colossal and the human suffering incalculable as corvée demands took their toll of agriculture. Millions, or rather ‘tens of hundreds of thousands’, are said to have dug the channels and distributed the spoil of Sui Yangdi’s waterways, though whether such figures refer to the total labour force involved or the total number of corvée periods worked is unclear. They used spades and picks, plus wicker baskets balanced at either end of a pole to maximise carrying capacity and absorb jolts. Wheeled transport was provided more by barrows than ox-carts.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The canal system could distribute only what the farmer could produce. But serious flooding of the Yellow River in 610/11 had reduced yields, while military requirements drained the labour pool and emptied the granaries. As the demand for manpower for both the army and public works raced ahead of supply, truancy increased and soon turned to popular revolt. Critics at court were ruthlessly silenced: powerful challengers began to mobilise within the provinces and the army. The final straw came when the last of three disastrous expeditions against Koguryo, a reluctant tributary state occupying much of Manchuria and northern Korea, was in 614 recalled in the face of minimal gains and escalating mutinies. Leaving the north in turmoil, in 616 Yangdi retired to the south. It had earlier been his adoptive homeland; now it became his last refuge. With Yangdi isolated from events as much by his tremulous courtiers as by distance, his megalomania subsided into melancholia. In 618, at his southern capital in what is now Yangzhou, he was murdered. The assassin was the son of one of his generals and a member of the once-purged Yuwen clan; but it could have been anyone.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The empire seemed to be relapsing into the anarchy of 400 years earlier, when the knights-errant of the emerging ‘Three Kingdoms’ had confronted the likes of ‘Poison Yu’ and ‘Yang of the Eighty-foot Moustache’. Between 614 and 624 some two hundred mutinies and rebellions reportedly affected practically every province and army unit.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Only in 617, when the emperor had practically retired and his empire was being torn apart by others, did Li Yuan endorse the Peach-plum prophecy about a Li succession, summon forces and supporters, enter the fray, and march on Chang’an. The city fell after a stout resistance. Li Yuan then went through the motions of installing one of Yangdi’s sons as emperor, all the while resisting appeals that he assume the Mandate himself. Heaven, of course, was not to be denied. Heeding the portents and prognostications cited by his supporters, within a year Li Yuan had had himself installed as emperor and had named his dynasty after his dukedom of Tang. During the short reign that followed (618–26), most of which was devoted to quelling opposition, the first of the Tang reinstated all but the most recalcitrant of Sui generals and officials. He and his successor would then adopt, with only minor adjustments, the entire Sui fiscal, military, administrative and legal framework.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Tang would last, at a generous estimate, for nearly three centuries.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the standard history of the Sui, the Turks are described as their own worst enemies, ‘preferring to destroy one another rather than live side by side’. Certainly a succession dispute in the 580s divided the Turk qaghanate into western and eastern branches. The former’s authority extended beyond the Tian Shan into what is now Kazakhstan and the latter’s throughout Mongolia and into western Manchuria. One contender for the qaghanate sought support, and then refuge, from Sui Wendi, who by dexterous intrigue promoted and exploited the divisions among the Turkic clans. But it would be left to Tang Taizong to perfect this policy and reap the dividends.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 838, a Japanese mission would fare better on the high seas and would yield the first account of life and travel in China to be penned by a foreigner. But the mission would also prove to be ‘the last to be dispatched abroad by the Imperial court of Japan until the nineteenth century’.19 Though cultural, commercial and piratical contacts flourished, authority in Japan fell a prey to feudalism and its diplomacy slipped into a millennium-long hibernation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Born in 599, the great Tang Taizong, constructor if not architect of the Tang empire, belonged to a generation of Asian empire-builders. From the Tsangpo basin of southern Tibet, Srong-brtsan-sgam-po, his exact contemporary, was masterminding the first unification of the scattered peoples of Asia’s high plateau to lay the foundations of a formidable Tibetan empire. Across the Himalayas in the Gangetic plain, Harsha-vardhana of Kanauj was performing a similar feat in establishing his imperial sway over the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of north India. Simultaneously the Sassanid ruler Chosroes (Khosrau) II was overrunning the Levant and Asia Minor to recreate a Persian empire that stretched from Xinjiang to Egypt. And in the far south-west, along the caravan routes of Arabia, another contemporary took rejection in Mecca as cause for flight (hegira or hijra) to Medina, where, acknowledged as the Prophet, he found a following and launched a crescentade that in less than a century would obliterate the Sassanids and buffet the frontiers of both India and China.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In all he covered a distance of perhaps 15,000 kilometres (9,320 miles), half of it during extensive wanderings in the Indian sub-continent that took him as far south as Tamil Nadu. He learnt new languages, explored new doctrines, won countless debates, went everywhere, met everyone, and kept a detailed record of it all. The qaghan of the Western Turks took a liking to him, the king of Samarkand let him conduct an ordination, and Emperor Harsha-vardhana became one of his keenest supporters. Indeed, most of what is known of Harsha and his empire, and of India in the seventh century, derives from Xuanzang’s Record of the Western Regions.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the Tibetans had renewed their solicitations to Chang’an, and in 641, with a view to ending their raids, Tang Taizong had granted the Tibetans what was in effect a ‘peace-through-kinship’ treaty. It was sealed as usual with the dispatch of an imperial princess. Further exchanges followed, the Tibetans regarding them as evidence of Tang vassalage and the Tang as evidence of Tibetan vassalage.21\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The rout of an embassy from the Son of Heaven, not to mention the Heavenly Qaghan, could not go unavenged. Wang Xuance demanded troops for a retaliatory attack on India and the Tibetans obliged. It was thus a joint Sino-Tibetan force that in 649, probably by way of the Chumbi pass between Sikkim and Nepal, crossed the Great Himalaya and inflicted a heavy defeat on Harsha’s successors. ‘Thereupon’, says the standard Tang history, ‘India was overawed.’ Elsewhere it is recorded that Wang Xuance brought back as a prisoner to Chang’an the man who had supposedly usurped Harsha’s throne. A statue of ‘this contumacious Indian’ was erected among the many in front of Tang Taizong’s tomb and ‘so [the Indian] found lasting fame – but as a trophy and an emblem’.22 Needless to say, Indian tradition is blissfully ignorant of all this. The Sino-Tibetan incursion probably affected only a corner of Bengal and had no known repercussions. Though a Chinese assault on Indian territory had been shown to be feasible, it would not be repeated until the 1960s.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Repeatedly she outwitted opponents, stymied rebellion, defended and extended the frontiers, and launched grand dynastic initiatives. Gaozong, the emperor, while he lasted, ‘sat with folded hands’, says Sima Guang; it was she who exercised supreme power; ‘promotion or demotion, life or death, were settled by her word’.11\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As noted, the histories gloss over Wu Zetian’s personal role in directing the wider business of the empire. Yet, on their own admission, and despite Tang Gaozong’s delaying his death until 683, it would seem that as of 655 ‘government proceeded from her alone’ and as of 664 ‘all the great powers of the empire devolved on the empress’.14 With or without her ailing and possibly epileptic husband, therefore, and despite the historians’ reticence, the empress must be held ultimately responsible for all transactions during her five decades of ascendancy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inflation became a feature of the period. Grain prices on the open market reportedly rose by a hundredfold from ‘the three or four cash per peck’ of Tang Taizong’s halcyon days.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though expansive and often downright aggressive, at few moments in history could the Chinese empire be characterised as militaristic. Military matters were traditionally treated as a subordinate function of the bureaucracy; under no circumstances should the bureaucracy become a subordinate function of the military. Theoretically, standing armies were anathema, professional soldiers parasites. Troops, whether conscripts or fubing (territorial militias), should be farmers-on-horseback and peasants-with-crossbows; generals should be, and usually were, bureaucrats-in-uniform. They were commissioned for a single campaign and, unless reappointed, reverted to civilian life after it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"through Xinjiang in 645, the harvest was substantial. All inner Asia was opened to Chinese penetration, and the so-called ‘Western Regions’ – an elastic term at the best of times – were stretched to their utmost. Under Tang Gaozong and Wu Zetian new protectorates were established over these frontier regions whose dependent territories sprawled in a great arc from Manchurian Andong on the Yellow Sea through what are now Outer Mongolia and eastern Kazakhstan to the deserts of Khorasan in north-eastern Persia/Iran. China’s empire would never again be so vast. On paper – itself a commodity symbolising both the novelty and fragility of the new imperium – Tang China was indeed ‘the greatest power in Asia at this time’.19\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Chinese ambivalence in military matters, and the ad hoc forces available for deployment, were woefully inadequate for maintaining an imperial colossus when challenged by other empire-builders.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The first of these challengers was Tibet. The amicable relations reached between Srong-brtsan-sgam-po and Tang Taizong had broken down around 660, the bone of contention being again the status of the Tuyuhun people in the treeless and boggy no man’s land that was Qinghai. By now, after various missions and a long stand-off over a Chinese envoy’s refusal to kowtow to the Tibetan king, the Tang should have realised that the Tibetans were not a mere confederation of nomadic tribes. An ambitious kingdom and would-be empire, Tibet had developed an integrated military, an effective administration and a literate culture based on its own grammar and script (an alphabetic one derived from a form of Sanskrit). The adoption of a distinctive and largely indigenous form of Buddhism (Vajrayana) was under way, metallurgical skills were highly developed, and Tibet’s mixed economy included artisans and traders as well as farmers and pastoralists.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China’s two decades of domination in Qinghai and southern Xinjiang gave way to what has been called the first Tibetan empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As the seventh century drew to a close, succession disputes within the Tibetan leadership led to a lull in hostilities. It ended in 700 with resounding Chinese victories and a peace settlement that was thrashed out in the dying days of Wu Zetian’s reign. Sealed with a Chinese bride in 707, the terms of the settlement were vague but again implied an equality of status that future emperors would find intolerable.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"No dynasty was graced by so many poets, or such famous ones, as the Tang.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Li Bo, ‘a Mozart of words’ and ‘the Chinese Byron’, was the more versatile.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Tang Xuanzong, whose forty-five-year reign (712–57) witnessed the greatest flowering of Tang poetry, was not therefore unusual in being himself a noted poet. He was also a musician, an actor and a connoisseur of most other arts. His patronage was lavish, poet Li Bo being among the many who benefited from it. ‘High Tang’, a phrase synonymous with Xuanzong’s reign, was as much a ‘golden age’ because of its artistic and cosmopolitan flamboyance as because of the empire’s comparative tranquillity and vast extent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As of 736, therefore, the court ceased its Luoyang shuttling and stayed put in Chang’an. The city duly became the undisputed Tang capital. Its grand dimensions as laid out under Sui Wendi had promised the most extensive city in the world; now, as its inhabitants surged towards 2 million, it became much the most populous city in the world.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Port cities such as Guangzhou in the deep south and Yangzhou in the Yangzi delta hosted large merchant and seafaring communities from Arabia, Persia, India and south-east Asia. But for exoticism nothing could match the great markets and court spectacles of Chang’an.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Indian mathematics and ayurvedic medicine were closely studied; and the Indian game of chess proved such a success that it was included in the curriculum of the Hanlin academy. Chinese artists delighted in depicting Indian deities and did so in a style that was itself decidedly hybrid.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Foreigners were closely monitored. They required a licence to trade and were separately domiciled.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By 750 all but one of the major commands were held by foreigners. Most of these men were Turks or part-Turk, though it was under a Korean general that the Tang forces were defeated by the Arabs at the Talas River in 751.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in 745 the sixty-year-old Tang Xuanzong had allowed his attention to stray from contemplation of the Daoist ineffable to admire the porcelain perfection and fashionably fulsome figure of one whose beauty was rivalled only by her vivacity. This was the famous Yang Guifei, and the emperor was instantly smitten. She had previously been the consort of one of his sons, so was probably no more than half his age, and through her influence over the emperor, she soon came to dominate the court. Under her patronage, a distant cousin, Yang Guozhong, emerged as Li Linfu’s main rival, and on the latter’s death in 752 as his ministerial successor. The Yangs were now all-powerful.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"probably just another attempt to smear his memory. But as between the general and the other Yang – chief minister Yang Guozhong – relations plummeted. Each saw the other as the only serious threat to his supremacy and intrigued against him.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Yet his sudden metamorphosis from palace pet to avenging pariah remains hard to explain. His actions of 755 can be construed either as careful preparation for revolt or as desperate responses to the increasingly ominous reports coming from Chang’an. Spies from the capital sent to investigate him were stalled or bribed, requests for his attendance at court rebuffed or ignored. When in late 755 he declined even to perform obeisance before an imperial envoy, it was tantamount to a declaration of war.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Claiming that he had been ordered to rid the empire of the far-from-popular Yang Guozhong, he marched forth at the head of his formidable army.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Chang’an and the Wei valley behind their screening mountains remained under imperial control. In fact they were reinforced by the recall of the frontier armies in Gansu, Xinjiang and Sichuan. Turks, Tibetans, Arabs and others would take advantage of this retraction to dismantle the empire’s entire western extension.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"An Lushan’s challenge to the authority of the central government had set a precedent. It betrayed the weakness of the dynasty, condemned it to invoking the support of military contingents as dangerous as the rebels, and hastened the devolution of power from the capital to the provinces.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in mid-756 the emperor and the impatient Yang Guozhong overruled their commanders to launch a massive counter-attack. It was ambushed and routed. Defeat left the capital undefended. As An Lushan advanced to claim the prize, all who could vacated the great city.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the emperor, the lovely Yang Guifei and the dictatorial Yang Guozhong, accompanied by attendants and a cavalry escort, fled towards Sichuan. The Yangs originated from there; the mountain trail through the Qinling, a successor of ‘Stone Cattle Road’, would discourage pursuit; and preparations had already been made for receiving the imperial entourage in Chengdu. Two weeks out, at a place called Mawei, they ran into a party of Tibetan envoys. The Tibetans wanted food, but Yang Guozhong’s dealings with them roused the suspicions of the imperial escort. Accused of treachery, Yang Guozhong was manhandled and murdered on the spot along with members of his family.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The emperor was unharmed in the fracas, as was Yang Guifei. But presumably to eradicate all hated Yangs, the troops now demanded that the emperor have her executed too. Powerless to protect his beloved, the emperor, it is said, concurred. Yang Guifei herself requested only that, instead of execution, she be strangled with a length of silk, whereupon the emperor’s trusted eunuch performed the deed. Thus did Yang Guifei pass to the spirit world with her beauty intact, there to be eventually reunited, in countless verses, plays, paintings, songs and novellas, with the emperor who so loved her. Romance transcends history. To ask why she had to die, or why the emperor, however old and powerless, failed the basic test of a hero in not dying with her, not even defending her, is beside the point. The emperor’s loss and his lover’s devotion were tragedy enough.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Broken-hearted, the great Tang Xuanzong continued on to Chengdu, to exile and to imminent abdication. He lived another five years, so outlasting An Lushan and witnessing the Tang restoration. In neither is he said to have taken the remotest interest.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"SEEN IN THE ESSENTIALLY DYNASTIC TERMS preferred by the traditional histories, little was changed by the An Lushan rebellion of late 755. An Lushan himself was murdered by his son in early 757. Later in the same year, with Uighur help, Chang’an was recaptured by Tang Suzong, Xuanzong’s designated heir (r. 756–62).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Assorted Turks and even an Arab contingent had joined the Tang forces against the rebels. But it was the Uighurs whose expert cavalry enabled the Tang to stem the tide of defeat, and Uighurs did not come cheap. A painful equality of status as well as massive subventions in cash and trade goods, plus an imperial bride, had to be extended to their qaghan,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the 843–48 crackdown on the Buddhist establishment may have occasioned as much misery as the Cultural Revolution. Thousands of monasteries are said to have been destroyed and as many as 250,000 monks and nuns defrocked, some being injured or killed in the process. Ennin portrays Tang Wuzong as a Daoist fanatic and notes that the Buddhists were not the only ones to suffer; Manichaeans, Nestorian Christians and Zoroastrians were also subject to censure. But as he admits, the motivation was as much economic as ideological. The dissolution of the monasteries brought the confiscation of their buildings, the repossession of their extensive landed estates, the return of their inmates and dependants to the tax and labour pool and, most important of all, the melting down of their vast accumulations of gold, silver and copper statuary to underpin the fragile currency.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in 780 a ‘two-tax system’ was introduced. ‘Generally considered one of the major events in Chinese economic history’, its ‘two-tax’ dimension was in fact incidental; it simply meant that, to spread receipts, it was levied in some areas at one time of the year, in others at another, and in most at both, in effect splitting the levy between late spring and harvest time.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since grain prices plummeted in the early ninth century, all who were assessed in cash but paid in grain found their liability soaring by the year; unable to meet the demand, peasants either deserted, leaving their peers to make good their contributions, or gravitated into paid labour;\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Tang Xianzong attempted to redress this situation, breaking up existing provinces and negotiating quotas direct with the smaller prefectures. But the cost of his military adventures was never covered, and any reduction in the military establishment by his successors invited mutiny.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It began in the 870s among bandit gangs on the western borders of Shandong. Joined by its eventual leader, a minor official from Shandong called Huang Chao, the revolt spread west to threaten Luoyang and then south to the middle Yangzi.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"provincial capitals were sacked; the administration collapsed throughout much of central China. A major Tang victory in 878 only spurred Huang Chao into one of the most outrageous peregrinations in history. Back in Shandong at the time, he led his men south to the Yangzi delta, crossed Zhejiang into the mountains of Fujian, and then trekked through some of the most difficult terrain in the country to Fuzhou and Guangzhou (Canton), both of which port cities he sacked. It was said that 120,000 were massacred in Guangzhou, over half the city’s population.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Emulating his great ancestor Tang Xuanzong, he and they fled into Sichuan. In early 881 Huang Chao entered the city in triumph and at first put on a brave display of founding his own dynasty. But his troops proved uncontrollable. Not for the first time the world’s greatest city was sacked and its palaces torched. Citoyens joined in the carnage, streets ran with blood. ‘The Lament of Lady Chin’, a long poem by Wei Zhuang, who himself fell foul of the rebels but later rose to prominence in Sichuan, paints a Goya-esque scene of devastation, rape, butchery and cannibalism. Suppressed by the poet himself, the poem in question was thought lost until no less then fourteen copies of it were found among Aurel Stein’s treasure trove from Dunhuang in the early twentieth century. Evidently it had struck a chord at the time.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The last Tang emperors, their names in Pinyin sounding an alphabetic cadenza (Yizong, Xizong, Zhaozong, Zhaoxuan), were paraded as puppets and died as pawns in the war games of their would-be successors.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Tang theoretically staggered on until 907, from which date the Standard Histories grudgingly recognise a Later Liang dynasty.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the resulting sequence of ‘Five Dynasties’ (Later Liang, Later Tang, Later Jin, Later Han, Later Zhou) gives its name to the whole period.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Traditionally dated 907–60, the ‘Five Dynasties’ period ended when the last of the five gave way to a sixth, the long-lasting Song. The Song would reunite most of the empire, and their accession is usually taken to mark the beginning of a dazzling new age.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This makes it difficult to answer some fundamental questions. How long has China been united? For how much of its history has it been ruled by Chinese? How continuous is its record of political integration? It all depends on how one defines the Chinese and where one starts the history. A timeline of empire based on the traditional dates of each all-China dynasty suggests that ‘the political coherence of [the] Chinese population…has been maintained for almost three-quarters of the time that has elapsed since the First Emperor of Qin’.12 So says the excellent Cultural Atlas of China, though The Cambridge History of China suggests ‘around half’ rather than ‘almost three-quarters’. Both assume that the Chinese population is synonymous with those considered ethnically and culturally Han, so excluding all those non-Han peoples prominent in the country’s history plus all those Tibetans, Uighurs and other minorities whom the government of today regards as Chinese. Moreover, both estimates raise the question of why earlier periods, like that of the pre-imperial Zhou and the ‘Warring States’ – periods more seminal to Chinese civilisation than the Greek and Roman republics to Mediterranean civilisation – should be left out of the equation. Include them, and the three-quarters-to-a-half of recorded history during which China has been ‘politically coherent’ shrinks to no more than a quarter.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The tendency has already been noted for official histories to exaggerate – or elasticate – the duration of favoured dynasties and credit them with exercising a universal authority that was not actually effective for anything like as long.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For instance, the empire of the Tang, though traditionally coterminous with the dynasty (618–907), can hardly be described as politically coherent after Huang Chao’s capture of Chang’an in 881; it had in fact been in turmoil throughout the three decades previous to that, and had been seriously compromised ever since An Lushan’s rebellion in 755.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As in the case of the ‘Great Wall’ or the ‘Grand Canal’, episodic segments of monumental achievement have been exaggerated and conflated to convey a misleading impression of near-continuity.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This is not to deny a remarkable continuity of political culture. The Mandate, the supremacy of Heaven’s Son, the concept of zhongguo (whether as ‘the central states’ or ‘the Middle Kingdom’), reverence for a political hierarchy grounded in Confucian morality, and the superiority of this shared culture over the uncultured ‘barbarism’ of non-Han peoples – these were universally acknowledged.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The development of printing, seven centuries before Gutenberg, and eleven before any of India’s scripts was printed, was undoubtedly the most momentous of all Chinese inventions; as a result, Europe and India still have dozens of languages and literatures but China only one. And this ‘infotech’ revolution substantially took place during the extended Five Dynasties/Ten Kingdoms period.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In general, Tang literary and artistic traditions fared better under the Ten Kingdoms than under the war-torn Five Dynasties in the north. In Hangzhou (the Wu-Yue, and nowadays Zhejiang, capital) and Nanjing (the capital of a ‘Southern Tang’ state), the poems of the great Tang masters appeared in print for the first time.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"At around the same time, and also in progressive Sichuan, printing facilitated the first-known appearance of paper money when merchants began issuing promissory notes in lieu of the often scarce and always burdensome strings of iron or copper cash. Officially certified and standardised under the Song, the practice gave birth to the banknote. Marco Polo’s description, three centuries later, of money ‘made out of the bark of trees’, while not entirely accurate, well conveys a foreigner’s utter incredulity at this momentous development: in converting arboreal pulp into a universally accepted medium of exchange with a value far in excess of its intrinsic worth, ‘you might say that the Great [Khubilai] Khan…has mastered the art of alchemy’, notes Polo. ‘He has such a quantity made that with it he could buy all the treasure of the world.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Helped by such innovations, much of the world’s treasure had been circulating more freely in China than anywhere else. As of the tenth century what has been called ‘a commercial revolution’ was under way.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the mid-eighth century, the total population is thought to have been around 60 million, of whom 60 per cent were living in the Yellow River basin. By the end of the tenth century, it was nearing 100 million, of whom less than 40 per cent resided in the Yellow River basin; over 60 per cent now lived in the Yangzi basin and the south. Accelerated by territorial losses in the north, the long-drawn-out shift to the more productive south had finally tipped the demographic scales. As of the Five Dynasties/Ten Kingdoms period, more Chinese grew rice than millet and wheat; their winters were warmer and their summers wetter; their acquaintance with the Inner Asian steppes was slight; and they lived not under the turbulent Five Dynasties but among the opulent but historically neglected Ten Kingdoms.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Later Zhou’s one great misfortune was the premature death of this Shizong, aged thirty-eight, in 959. His seven-year-old son succeeded him, but within months the dynasty was challenged by its most trusted general. A certain Zhao Kuangyin, fearless in battle and consummate in statecraft, this was the man who, as the next dynastic founder, would be posthumously known as Song Taizu (r. 960–76). At the time he appeared just another usurper. His background was identical to other contenders’. His prospects seemed no better than those of the five ephemeral dynasties to which he was about to add a sixth. Sure enough, move for move, his usurpation mirrored that of the Later Zhou. Other potential contenders were won over, while in public he proclaimed himself utterly unworthy of the throne; but his troops and their commanders clamoured for his elevation; the portents were adamant; and the matter was settled when, acknowledging his superior merit, the mother of the last of the Later Zhou insisted on her son abdicating in his favour.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Song rule was revealed as more formal and much more restrained than that of the Tang. Executions and floggings would be comparatively rare, vendettas and purges comparatively few. Though the founding brothers campaigned vigorously, and though the forces under their direct control were massively augmented to nearly a million men, both they and their successors emphasised civilian rule.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Fresh to the throne, in 979 Song Taizong overran a part of Shanxi to which the Later Han (fourth of the Five Dynasties) had retired, and in the process inflicted a heavy defeat on a Khitan Liao army sent to assist this time-warped enclave. Success then encouraged Song Taizong to defy all advice to the contrary and invade Liao itself. His exhausted troops reached the Liao capital at what is now Beijing ill prepared and short of supplies. They were routed. Vast quantities of booty and weaponry were lost. Taizong himself was reduced to fleeing the field of battle in a cart, ever the most ignominious of imperial fates.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Two years later the Liao emperor died in a hunting accident and was succeeded by the eleven-year-old Liao Shenzong (r. 982–1031). Sensing an opportunity for revenge, Song Taizong resumed the offensive. But he reckoned without the military skills and formidable resolve of a Khitan dowager empress. In 986 Dowager Empress Chengtian took the field in person at the head of the Khitan forces and thrice defeated the Song armies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In essence the Shanyuan treaty of 1005 amounted to a damaging acknowledgement that empire was divisible and that non-Han rulers like the Khitan might also enjoy some pedigree of legitimacy – a Mandate, as it were, for ‘All-not-under-Heaven’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It may, then, be helpful to think of China’s history post-950 as following a two-track narrative. The tracks diverge and converge with much interchange between them. China’s historians traditionally present the crossover as essentially one sided, with the non-Han northern rulers gradually adopting the superior cultural norms of the indigenous Han southerners. But evidence that Khitan, Jurchen, Mongol and Manchu were fully alert to what they saw as the dangers of creeping sinification might suggest otherwise. Certainly, non-Han regimes whose subjects were overwhelmingly Han had perforce to compromise, even conform. But so too, if careers were to prosper, did their Han adjutants and subordinates.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Eventually the compromise evident in the bilingualism of the Liangzhou stele emerged. To the Song, the Xia ruler remained a subject, in kinship terms ‘a son’ not ‘a brother’, but he was also accepted as a quasi-emperor whose use of imperial regalia and protocol within his own domain would not be contested. Like Liao, Xia became the recipient of an annual subsidy from the Song; it included several tonnes of brick tea as well as copious quantities of silver and silk. And the all-important border markets were reopened, so giving the Song access to Tangut bloodstock and the Tangut somewhere to spend their tribute.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The tripartite arrangement proved workable and, however distasteful to Song Confucianists and later historians, may be seen as an example of a sustainable multi-state system.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"And both identified Buddhism as the latter-day source of all corruption. It was ‘an opiate of the people’ even, and all the more so now that it was central to the pretensions of both Tangut Xia and Khitan Liao. ‘Trumpeting abroad its grand, fantastic doctrines’, as Ouyang Xiu put it, this evil could best be defeated by a return to Confucian ‘rites and rightness,…the fundamental things whereby Buddhism may be defeated’.8\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Reform would repeatedly falter because, on losing the emperor’s favour, it must languish for want of concerted support; Ouyang Xiu’s plea for the recognition of parties had merely elicited their proscription; and as F. W. Mote puts it in his Imperial China, ‘China still struggles with the heritage of this eleventh-century political failure’.10\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Wang Anshi was about to introduce what amounted to the most ambitious scheme of reorganisation ever attempted during the two millennia between the reign of the First Emperor and the triumph of the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘The Major Reforms’ or ‘New Policies’ of Wang Anshi included economic and social provisions of which any responsible government could be proud. A system of designedly low-interest loans to tide the cultivator over until harvest time was introduced; and the principle of state granaries buying at above-market rates when prices were depressed, and selling below when they were buoyant, was reactivated.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Ad hoc enactment, piecemeal implementation and a mixed reception seem to have characterised the whole programme. Moreover the dramatic increase in tax receipts that resulted, though notable and needful, can hardly have eased the taxpayer’s burden.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"by all accounts, the period of the Song was ‘China’s greatest age’.15 Revolts broke out in Shandong and Zhejiang during the dynasty’s dying days in the early 1120s, but for the most part it had been an era of internal tranquillity, booming trade, technological innovation and cultural sophistication. Around 5 per cent of the population lived in cities, not a spectacularly high proportion but still about 6 million people, a figure ‘probably equal to the urban population of the rest of the world at that time’.16 Kaifeng, the capital and much the largest conurbation, was smaller than Chang’an under the Tang yet accounted for about a million, ‘which is not far short of the total population of England under William the Conqueror, the exact contemporary of [Song] Shenzong’.17 There were thirty cities with populations of 40,000–100,000; Europe had perhaps six. As centres of commerce and overseas trade Yangzhou (in Jiangsu), Hangzhou (in Zhejiang), Fuzhou and Quanzhou (in Fujian) and Guangzhou (Canton, in Guangdong) all rivalled Venice.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To the medieval European visitor, China afforded a glimpse of a futuristic utopia in which industry and abundance were complemented by just and effective government.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To printed books and paper money might be added a host of contemporary developments in medicine, mechanics, mathematics, chemistry and metallurgy. Of the three inventions credited by Francis Bacon with having changed his sixteenth-century European world – printing, the magnetic compass and gunpowder – all had been anticipated by the Chinese and all had entered everyday use under the Song, so distinguishing that age of innovation from the Tang age of importation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Surveying and map-making achieved a high degree of accuracy; so did astronomy, ever a strong suit in the Celestial Empire. A calculation of the world’s circumference proved accurate to within a matter of metres; the fall of the Grand Canal over a 420-kilometre (260-mile) section was measured to within millimetres.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘In the rogues’ gallery of Chinese history, Hailing Wang occupies a place of honour,’ writes a sarcastic Herbert Franke in The Cambridge History of China; ‘he even became an anti-hero in popular pornography, where his exploits are embellished with gusto.’25 Both emperors had no compunction in murdering enemies, executing supposed opponents and abusing their womenfolk in defiance of custom. They were violent and dangerous autocrats. Yet they were by no means tribal ruffians, and their victims were more often Jurchen chiefs than Han subjects. Both spoke Chinese and had received an upbringing in the Confucian classics. Hailing reputedly composed elegant verse. His intelligence was formidable, and if he inspired universal fear, he did so in the conviction that terror had its place in the authoritarian tradition of Han-type emperorship.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Undeterred by Earth having sustained long-lasting dynasties like the Han and Tang, the Song hastened to invade. In 1208 their forces pushed north across the Huai River. They met unexpectedly stiff resistance and found surprisingly few defectors. Instead Sichuan, part of their own empire, chose to revolt. Like the Jin attack of 1161, the campaign achieved next to nothing beyond discrediting the belligerent party. Lu You lived to see its failure and die a disappointed man.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"That was in 1210. A year later, the Mongols ceased their sporadic raiding of Jin territory to launch a full-scale invasion. Chinggis Khan in person led one of the two armies, each of about 50,000 well-mounted archers, that began systematically plundering the Jin empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"AFTER THE SONG THERE WOULD BE just three more imperial dynasties: the Mongol Yuan (1279–1368), the Ming (1368–1644) and the Manchu Qing (1644–1911).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"That left the Song at the apex of the dynastic trajectory. The Song, and more especially the sunset blaze of the Southern Song (1127–1279), would come to be seen as a halcyon age of imperial China.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Yunnan and then in Mongolia, Khubilai’s success had owed much to the manpower, revenue and advice available from his Chinese subjects. His fellow Mongols despised such indulgence of a conquered people, decried his adoption of a settled lifestyle and ridiculed him for preferring Chinese forms of sovereignty over the cut-and-thrust charisma of traditional steppe dominion. Indeed, the war of succession between the Mongol princes had been seen as a conflict between opposing styles of rulership as much as contending personalities. But whether willing convert or wily statesman, Khubilai seemed enthralled by his Chinese dominion at the expense of his Mongol heritage.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1272, while the Southern Song yet reigned in the south, Khubilai clearly signified acceptance of the Mandate. He did so in a formal announcement declaring that his dynasty was to be known by the unusual title of (Da) Yuan, ‘(Great) Originator’. Historians ought to be eternally grateful. The tiresomely confusing habit of recycling old dynastic names had finally been broken. As he proudly explained, ‘Yuan’ derived neither from his state of origin, like Qin and Han, nor from some feudal dukedom, like Sui and Tang. ‘In all these cases, they [the dynasties] fell prey to the ingrained habits of common people…[and] adopted momentary measures of expediency for the sake of control,’ he declared.18 Clearly they were doomed. Khubilai, successor to the ‘sage-like’ Chinggis Khan and now ruler of the largest empire Heaven had ever seen, was above such parochialism. On the best possible advice, he had sourced his dynastic title in the ‘Book of Changes’ (Yi-jing, I-Ching), perhaps the most venerable of all the ancient classics.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The story of the Yuan dynasty reads as one of protracted decline, and since Khubilai occupied the throne for another fifteen years – longer than any of his nine dynastic successors bar the last – he must bear much of the responsibility. He failed to override the chaotic system of succession that threw up all these quickfire emperors. His administrative arrangements, far from centralising authority, seem to have dispersed it. His attempts to improve agricultural production did little to improve revenue receipts and nothing to reverse the decline in population, itself the result of plague and famine as well as incessant war. And his foreign adventures brought still less in the way of returns and were seldom short of catastrophic. All these failures could be attributed to advancing years and declining health.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By the time of his own death aged nearly eighty in 1294, he was crippled with gout, often insensate from alcohol and quite grotesquely obese.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When in 1313–15 the examination system was reintroduced by the scholarship-loving Ayurbarwada or Yuan Renzong (r. 1311–20), it was effectively ‘dumbed down’ to give the less-educated Mongols and their ‘coloured-eyed’ henchmen a better chance. Literary composition was excluded altogether; Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucian ‘Four Books’ distillation became the basic syllabus; degrees were awarded in accordance with preset ethnic quotas; and lest Han scholars still outshine their non-Han competitors, the latter were encouraged with simplified papers and lower pass marks.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In adopting Nanjing, Zhu Yuanzhang, the Ming founder, would be the first to rule all China from a southern city.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As Zhu Yuanzhang’s 1367 proclamation put it, the Yuan, though initially legitimate, had ‘deserted the norms of conduct’ and ‘the time had come when Heaven despised them and no longer sustained their rule’.28 In January 1368 Zhu followed this up with a formal declaration of his own dynasty. It was to be called ‘the Great Ming’, ‘Ming’ meaning ‘brilliant’ or ‘effulgent’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nine months later Ming forces entered Dadu (Beijing) almost unopposed. Yuan Shundi had fled north into Inner Mongolia. For the first time in centuries China had a Chinese emperor, and for only the second time ever, he was a man of the people.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The credentials of the Ming dynasty (r. 1368–1644) were so impressive that later nationalists would hail Zhu Yuanzhang’s achievement as a triumphant reassertion of Han Chinese identity after centuries of ‘alien rule’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Following their triumphs in the north, in the 1370s Ming armies struck deep into Mongolia, but with dwindling success. Mongol cavalry still enjoyed supremacy on the steppe. The Yuan and their adherents soon reclaimed what is now Inner Mongolia and would show themselves more than capable of striking back into northern China. The Mongol threat would dangle over the Ming for another two centuries, to be nullified only when the Jurchen, reincarnated as the Manchu, replaced it with a still greater menace.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though piously claiming to be restoring the institutions and rituals of the Tang and the Song, in practice Zhu Yuanzhang seemed bent on reconstituting the empire he had just toppled. Khubilai’s division of the country into provinces was retained,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Compared to the Song, the Mongol Yuan emperors had seemed beyond Confucian remonstrance, autocratic in their exercise of power and arbitrary in their judgements. But compared to the Mongol Yuan, Zhu Yuanzhang was even worse. Courtiers and ministers were beaten in his presence, sometimes to death, and as of the great purge of 1380 that accounted for those 30,000–40,000 lives, scarcely a day passed without mass executions. No reign of terror in Chinese history can compare with it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Yongle emperor, then (r. 1403–24), third son of the rags-to-ruler-ship Hongwu emperor, was the former prince of Yan who successfully challenged the young Jianwen emperor (r. 1399–1402), captured Nanjing and eventually moved the capital back north to the site of the Mongols’ Dadu. There, having renamed it Beijing, the Yongle emperor began constructing a spacious new metropolis. It took most of his reign, and its innermost ‘Forbidden City’ is substantially that which remains to this day.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China looked poised to command the seas and engross that trade on which, within a century, European states would construct empires and claim world dominion. But in China’s case nothing of the sort happened. Rather did the Yongle initiative discredit the whole idea of overseas enterprise. The great ships were allowed to rot; the construction of replacements was specifically forbidden; and so, for over a century, were all but coastal sailings. Subsequent mention of the voyages is so rare that some scholars would come to doubt whether they ever took place; others, going to the opposite extreme, have exploited the paucity of records to postulate preposterous theories of polar endeavour and world circumnavigation; nearly all have wondered why so ambitious a scheme was suddenly adopted and then, just as suddenly, abandoned.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Thus the main reason for scouring the Indian Ocean as given in Zheng He’s biography in the Ming dynastic history was to track down the Jianwen emperor, the nephew whom the Yongle emperor had overthrown. This was partly a red herring, partly a convenient fabrication, the intent being to rally support for the voyages from a Confucian bureaucracy that disliked their expense, resented eunuchs commanding them and yet could ill afford to appear other than zealous in eliminating any threat to the Yongle emperor’s legitimacy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1404/05 Timur actually set off for China leading an army of 200,000. But he died within a matter of weeks, whereupon the campaign was aborted amid the usual Mongol succession struggle. Timur’s troops never reached the limits of Ming rule in Gansu; the Yongle emperor seems not to have taken the danger very seriously;\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The contribution of Zheng He’s voyages to this diplomatic traffic is especially notable. During the twenty-two years of the Yongle period some ninety-five missions from the states of south-east Asia and the Indian Ocean reached the Ming court, many of them aboard Zheng He’s ships. The emperor ‘wanted to display his soldiers in strange lands in order to make manifest the wealth and power of the Middle Kingdom’, explains the Ming dynastic history. Zheng He was commissioned, says a stele erected by him at the port of Changle (near Fuzhou), ‘to go to the [foreigners’] countries and confer presents on them so as to transform them by displaying our power while treating distant peoples with kindness’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Instead he sent an army of 215,000 to invade. Worse still, in 1407, after a comprehensive victory, he annexed Annam, renaming it the Ming province of Jiaozhi. This is what it had been called under the Han, and now as then the Annamese proved anything but agreeable. Drawing on cherished memories of the Trung sisters, those indomitable Boadiceas who had defied the armies of the Later Han, they found inspirational leadership in members of the Tran and Le clans, plus a spirit of unquenchable resistance that freedom fighters of a later age would recognise as pristine nationalism.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The hostilities that followed lasted twenty years. Thrice the country was thought pacified and thrice revolt broke out anew. The Ming forces seldom lost a battle; the Vietnamese never gave up the fight. By land and sea, more and more troops and supplies went south, but it made no difference. Terrain and climate weakened the invader and favoured the guerrilla tactics of the invaded. By the mid-1420s the Vietnamese resistance enjoyed almost universal support under the great Le Loi, a patriot who would one day inspire the young Nguyen Ai Quoc, otherwise Ho Chi Minh. (But the twentieth-century parallels are too numerous for mention.)\"\n\n---------\n\n\"After centuries of slow encroachment, examination candidates were at last coming into their own as office-holders. Indeed, ‘at no time in China’s premodern history was government in all its aspects more dominated by civil servants recruited and promoted on the basis of merit than in Ming times’.13\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By the late sixteenth century, ‘there were between one million and ten million men who had been educated to [the basic examinations] level’, a remarkable figure for a time when elsewhere even basic literacy barely registered. It represented 10–20 per cent of the adult male population, with 1 per cent proceeding to exam-certificated status and 0.01 per cent to jinshi rank.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If the Tumu Incident had disgraced the dynasty in the eyes of the empire, the Great Rites Controversy disgraced it in the eyes of its own officials.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"with no incentive to save on manpower, mechanisation had limited appeal and industrialisation was delayed; mass production came to mean production by the masses rather than the production of a mass of standardised items using minimal labour.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The ‘Great Wall’ was unquestionably a Ming creation, both in terms of its construction and of its later repute. But plaques recording different stages of its construction are rare and only a few bricks bear an incised indication of their provenance. Moreover, archaeologists, faced with a site 6,000–7,000 kilometres (3,700–4,350 miles) long, remain more concerned about conserving what can be seen than exhuming what cannot.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Some time after midnight on 25 April 1644, accompanied only by an old eunuch, the Ming Chongzhen emperor, grandson of the Wanli emperor, ascended Coal Hill, an eminence within the Forbidden City, surveyed Beijing’s unmanned walls and the fires that raged in the still-dark suburbs beyond, and then, retiring into a nearby pavilion – it was the headquarters of the Imperial Hat and Girdle Department – hanged himself from a cross-beam. On 5 June Manchu forces entered the city, quickly occupied the palace and, declaring the Mandate forfeit, arrogated it to their own pre-declared Qing dynasty. The deer had been loose, as the saying had it, for just six weeks.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Ming’s nearly twenty-seven decades were up, the Qing’s nearly twenty-eight just beginning; a tired and now ineffectual regime looked to have succumbed to a fresh and still-dynamic one.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By the late eighteenth century, thanks to the Qing, China would have acquired the subcontinental girth that it rejoices in to this day. On the other hand the price for neglecting its seaboard and underestimating the foreigners who increasingly frequented it would be national humiliation, and not just by trading companies, upstart empires and ‘great powers’ but by domestic revolutionaries, opportunistic neighbours and itinerant ideologues.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the year 1644 – or less explicitly, the first half of the seventeenth century – is taken to mark an important milestone in China’s historical marathon. Hereabouts period-conscious histories flag the end of one era, or ‘world cycle’, and the beginning of another, though whether ‘late feudal’ is superseded by ‘proto-capitalist’, ‘late imperial’ by ‘post-imperial’ or ‘pre-modern’ by ‘early modern’ is a matter of mouth-watering debate.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"generalising about the empire is shown to be a dangerous exercise. Not only taxation but crops, productivity, patterns of landownership, standards of law and order, and levels of social well-being varied enormously from province to province, prefecture to prefecture, and county to county.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Paper money had first run into problems under the Yuan dynasty. Insufficiently backed by silver, copper or even silk, new issues of notes had been declared non-convertible by the Mongol regime. As a result they rapidly lost their face value and were generally shunned; those who could preferred to hoard metals. The Hongwu emperor, founder of the Ming, had persisted with paper and shut down mining operations to cut off the supply of metals. But this merely boosted their value, especially that of silver. By 1400 the purchasing power of silver was higher in China than anywhere else in the world, and would remain so. The country ‘had entered a new monetary age in which unminted silver traded by weight, and copper coins both legal and counterfeit, were the dominant forms of currency’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Though all Chinese dynasties might reasonably be described as conquest dynasties, none had conquered less of China before gaining the throne than the Manchus.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Hong Taiji also began employing Han bureaucrats, selected by examination, to staff an administrative service. An external affairs bureau was set up, too; initially concerned with Jurchen–Mongol relations, the bureau was soon reorganised and renamed to handle all ‘colonial’ relations, including the close ties lately established between the Mongols and the Tibetan religious establishment, especially its Dalai Lama (of whom more later).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A newer, more inclusive orientation was needed: the Bannermen, and by extension the regime, were henceforth to be known as ‘Manchu’, and the dynasty as ‘Qing’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Manchu’ is more problematic. Freely used, and by foreigners often confused with Tatar/Tartar and Mongol, the word was soon applied to the dynasty as well as the people and then to the north-eastern region from which both originated: hence the word manchuguo/manchu-kuo/ ‘Manchuria’, a term that the Chinese have since found objectionable, partly because the Japanese adopted it as the name for their twentieth-century puppet state in that region and partly because it implies a distinct status for somewhere that the Chinese now consider as just north-east China and no more distinct than, say, south-east China.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By then the ‘great enterprise’ had been substantially realised and resistance to Qing rule lingered on only in out-of-the-way places such as Yunnan and Taiwan.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Undermined by Nanjing’s dithering and more desertions, Yangzhou soon fell to the Manchus. Shi Kefa died in the carnage, the most elegant of port cities was comprehensively sacked, and the entire populace massacred or enslaved. Three weeks later, without a fight, Nanjing itself surrendered, and the first of the four ‘Southern Ming’ regimes promptly collapsed. From a Manchu point of view, Yangzhou’s salutary fate had served its purpose of deterring opposition. On the other hand, the ten-day slaughter, ‘one of the most infamous massacres in Chinese history’, and especially the fate of Yangzhou’s womenfolk, all of which was chronicled in explicit detail, would top every subsequent indictment of Manchu excesses; and in the heroic figure of Shi Kefa, the Ming resistance – not to mention a patriotic posterity transfixed by the fate of China’s last indigenous dynasty – would recognise its first great martyr.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A more intriguing feature of the fighting was the widespread use of firearms. The war, in fact, was the first on Chinese soil in which guns look to have played a decisive part.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"who’d been on the wall’.11 Though Yangzhou’s walls were clearly not designed for it, artillery was no novelty. Joseph Needham dates the first Chinese ordnance to around 1250, and there is a cannon of sorts in Beijing’s National History Museum with a date equivalent to 1332.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"according to the Standard History of the Ming, the first serviceable guns were acquired in 1410 in the course of the Ming Yongle emperor’s long and otherwise unrewarding vendetta against the Vietnamese;\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Qing dynasty’s famous ‘Three Emperors’ – those of the Kangxi (1661–1722), Yongzhen (1723–35) and Qianlong (1723–95) reign periods – monopolised the throne until the dawn of the nineteenth century. Capable, generally conscientious and occasionally capricious, they gave the empire unprecedented continuity and comparative stability.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"During the same period, monarchies elsewhere fared indifferently: thirteen Mughal emperors came and went as India succumbed to foreign conquest; seven British sovereigns, three being Georges, fretted over the constraints of constitutional monarchy; and five French kings, all called Louis, eked out their ancien régime until overwhelmed by the revolution. Qing China, like Romanov Russia, bucked the trend.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Voltaire, likewise, exulted over a society that, innocent of church or clergy, yet cherished moral values. China’s ‘constitution’ he ranked ‘the best in the world’; and he wrote poems in honour of the Qianlong emperor.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Taiwan, or Formosa, as the Portuguese had called it, was not at the time a province of China. Sparsely populated by a non-Han and implacably hostile people, and with a climate of equally evil repute, the island had tendered tribute to the Ming but had attracted no more settlement than the neighbouring Ryukyu Islands. This, however, was changing. The enterprising Zheng family of Xiamen (Amoy) in Fujian – part privateers, part Mandarin traders, latterly Ming officials and increasingly coastal overlords – had used the island as an occasional naval base and had encouraged the Dutch settlement there.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"was this measure, plus an overland approach by Qing forces, which in 1661 triggered the first great wave of mainland migration to Taiwan. It also determined Zheng Chenggong himself to relocate there. Only the Dutch in their fort on Taiwan stood in the way.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To Zheng Chenggong’s considerable reputation as the most daring of sea-dogs and the most loyal of Ming supporters was added the accolade, later upgraded to semi-divine status, of being the first patriot to inflict defeat on a European intruder and expel its representatives from what he proudly claimed as Chinese territory.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Zheng Chenggong’s son succeeded to the Taiwanese patrimony and, more merchant prince than Ming loyalist, let alone Chinese patriot, would befriend early traders of England’s East India Company. When in 1683 his navy was finally sunk by a Qing armada, the latter was commanded by one of his father’s old comrades-in-arms. The defeat of the Zheng meant that Taiwan could at last be incorporated into the empire. With its Han population augmented by further waves of migration following a revolt in 1721, it remained a prefecture attached to Fujian province for a couple of centuries. By the time it was wrested from the Qing in 1898 by the Japanese, temples to Zheng Chenggong abounded there; in fact even the Qing had eventually recognised Zheng as ‘a Paragon of Loyalty’. The Japanese had no problem with this. Zheng, after all, had been born near Nagasaki of a Japanese mother; they too revered his memory.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the Kangxi emperor further strengthened his position among his conquered subjects by reversing some of the blatantly pro-Manchu measures taken by his regent predecessors.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"If, as sometimes contended, the Treaty of Nerchinsk should be regarded as the first of imperial China’s ‘unequal treaties’, that was not how the signatories read it, nor were the Chinese disadvantaged by it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For China the treaty was nevertheless an important first. Since it implicitly acknowledged the existence of another sovereign state – so contradicting the traditional concept of the universal Mandate that underlay all those peace-through-kinship and trade-as-tribute agreements – the act of signature certainly constituted ‘the most significant Qing concession’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Russians relinquished claims to the Amur in return for commercial access to the Qing empire; the Qing got a secure frontier and a neutral neighbour.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"more is known about the character of the Kangxi emperor than any previous ruler of China. He is revealed as a sympathetic figure who would surely have enjoyed a favourable press without the later official eulogies to his all-conquering exploits. Spirited, decisive, insatiably inquisitive and devoted to his growing family, he was also genuinely concerned for the welfare of his troops. He took a lively interest in practically everything that came to his attention. He was especially passionate about hunting, some letters reading more like entries in a game-book. Indeed, Galdan is identified as his personal prey, his prize quarry; he would track him, it seemed, to the ends of the earth. Hunting him and his successors became an obsession, pursued regardless of cost, sometimes of reason, and to the detriment of regional stability. Like Han Wudi or Tang Taizong, the Kangxi emperor knew not when to stop; and since he was mostly successful, he set standards of intervention in Inner Asia that his Qing successors would feel obliged to follow.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"From 1690 to 1760 the ‘Three Emperors’ conducted against the Zunghar Mongols a devastatingly long, if intermittent, war of attrition. It was a conflict of many phases and highly complex relationships involving not only numerous Mongol confederations but most of Inner Asia’s other peoples. The size of Qing territory would be doubled as a result, and something approximating the configuration of China today would emerge.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Exterminate’ was the constant Qing refrain, at first in respect of the Zunghar leaders, then of the entire people when in the 1750s the Qianlong emperor sought what one authority does not hesitate to call ‘the final solution’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Of the 600,000 Zunghars, it was reported that 40 per cent had died of smallpox, 30 per cent had been killed by the Qing armies and 20 per cent had fled across the Russian, Kazakh and Kyrghyz frontiers. ‘Zungharia was left as a blank social space, to be filled by a state-sponsored settlement movement of millions of Han Chinese peasants, Manchu Bannermen, Turkestani oasis settlers, Hui [Chinese Muslims] and others.’25\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Southern Xinjiang’s conquest came last and was a direct result of the Qing victory in Zungharia. In fact it was conducted by the same Qing general fresh from his Zungharian triumphs. The Zunghar Mongols had depended on Xinjiang’s oasis-cities, by now with a substantial Muslim Uighur population, for supplies and taxes, and had exercised a loose supervision over them. The Qing elimination of the Zunghars left a power vacuum that members of a formerly prominent and still greatly revered Muslim family sought to fill. These were the Khojas of the Naqshbandi sect of Sufis, whose authority in the region spread even to Kashmir and Afghanistan and had occasionally been endorsed by the Zunghars.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Despite latter-day opinion, as yet ‘there was no unified “Uighur” nationality either fighting against the Qing state or yearning to be incorporated within it’.26 The region was indeed incorporated within the empire, but not as a regular province. ‘Xinjiang’s overall administration [under the Qing] was in essence nothing more than a huge garrison under the command of the military governor.’ Officials there ‘neither respected nor learned much about the languages and customs of the people whom they ruled’. They learned even less about the nominally jimi (‘loose rein’) lands beyond, including Tashkent, Bukhara, Afghanistan and Hunza in what is now northern Pakistan, over all of which the Qing inherited a vague suzerainty.27\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Tibet’s involvement in the Qing–Zunghar conflict was very different. It preceded that of Xinjiang and was much more influential, though the outcome was less conclusive. Like Taiwan, and despite vague claims by the Yuan dynasty, Tibet had never been administratively part of any Chinese empire. But the Mongols had become intimately involved in Tibet’s religious politics, mostly as champions of the Yellow-hatted order of monks (Gelugpa), whose spiritual leader was the Dalai Lama of Lhasa.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Matters were vastly complicated by two further factors: the first was the rival claims of other senior lamas, both Mongol and Tibetan, whether Yellow-hatted (like the Panchen Lamas of Tashilunpo) or not (like those of other orders); and the second was the dilemmas arising from a firm belief in the principle, and much latitude in the practice, of reincarnate succession. As a manifestation of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteswara, the Dalai Lama did not die; but when relinquishing one incarnation, he left it to others to determine the next, so creating great potential for controversy and uninvited interference.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To avoid this, the Great Fifth’s ‘non-death’ in 1682 was kept secret from the Kangxi emperor for sixteen years. The emperor blamed Galdan and his Zunghars for contributing to the deception and endorsed intervention by a loyal (to the Qing) Mongol confederation from Qinghai. These Qinghai Mongols, keen to unseat the Zunghar-backed administration in Tibet and its Sixth Dalai Lama, reached Lhasa, but were in turn evicted by their Zunghar brethren.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Imperial troops were then sent to the rescue, and in 1720, for the first time, entered Lhasa. The Zunghars evacuated the city ahead of their arrival, the Qing Banners occupied it, and a Seventh Dalai Lama was installed. A precedent for Qing protection in central Tibet had finally been established; civil power was now entrusted to a council of ministers who would be advised by two Beijing-appointed ambans (‘commissioners’ from the Qing Colonial Office, they ‘were basically political informants’) and a few troops were left to support them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Qing intervention in Tibet in the eighteenth century was designed to uphold the religious establishment and the spiritual authority of the Dalai Lama, not to undermine them. The Manchu emperors were as sincere in their regard for the reincarnate lamas as were the Mongol khans, and just as jealous of Tibetan endorsement. Arguably Tibetan Buddhism gained more from imperial patronage than did the Qing from political intervention.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Other Qing interventions in Burma, Vietnam and Nepal during the Qianlong period would prove unproductive, even disastrous.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Non-Chinese historians are more inclined to equate Qing expansion into the steppe and the desert with other contemporary colonialisations in Siberia and the Americas. China does not like to be considered a colonial power; but in Beijing’s prompt efforts to demarcate, map and regulate these new regions, to settle their existing populations, to encourage or condone inward migration, and to realise their resources, the criteria of colonialism are discernible.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In keeping with the scale of the thing, Macartney’s diplomatic wish-list was also ambitious. China and Britain were to establish amicable and reciprocal relations. He was to persuade the emperor to agree to his staying on as a permanent British ambassador in Beijing and to encourage the dispatch of a complementary Chinese embassy to London.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In a parting edict addressed by the emperor to George III and entrusted to the mission for delivery, the British king was congratulated on his ‘sincere humility and obedience’. Any permanent embassy, however, was contrary to ritual practice ‘and definitely cannot be done’. Trade required no such level of representation; there were already channels for redress in the event of disputes; as for island ‘magazines’ and additional ports, they were not so much as mentioned. Knick-knacks such as guns and instruments the emperor did not value, ‘nor do we have the slightest need of your country’s manufactures’. In effect, reciprocity with the Celestial Empire remained an impertinent notion as well as a contradiction in terms: ‘You, O King, should simply act in conformity with our wishes by strengthening your loyalty and swearing perpetual obedience so as to ensure that your country may share the blessings of peace.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even the emperor’s edict, though unbending in its assumption of imperial supremacy and sino-centric ascendancy, has been called ‘the most important single Chinese document for the study of Sino-Western relations between 1700 and 1860’ – no mean claim for a period during which China’s international reputation would plummet as the Western powers presumed to extract concessions and the empire itself started to unravel.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Of the three major themes of the Qing period – the successful expansion into Inner Asia, a mixed record in managing the empire and its vastly increased population, and the disastrous handling of the insistent Western demand for commercial penetration – it is the last which has usually received the greatest attention.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Macartney noted the shortage of flintlocks and the antiquated nature of China’s ordnance; he foresaw that ‘half a dozen broadsides’ would level the forts that protected Guangzhou, that ‘a few frigates’ could destroy the coastal shipping of the entire country, and that Indo-British forces ‘might vulnerate them [the Chinese] as sensibly in other quarters’, such as along Tibet’s Himalayan frontier.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Our present interests, our reason, and our humanity equally forbid the thoughts of any offensive action,’ he concluded.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The ship’s commanders whom Macartney so admired were the ‘Three Emperors’ of the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns. But in September 1793, when Macartney met him at Jehol, the last of these was just three days short of his eighty-fourth birthday. He looked younger and was still healthy; but he had already declared his intention of abdicating so that his reign would not outlast and so, in most unfilial fashion, eclipse that of his Kangxi grandfather.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Under the Qing, encouraging wealth creation was acknowledged as a function of the state, and the Confucian disparagement of merchants and credit agencies became largely rhetorical.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the population went on growing. The statistics remain controversial. A figure of around 300 million by the year 1800, about twice that of all Europe at the time, is generally accepted, though what rate of growth this represents is uncertain.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Theoretically, and to a wide extent in practice, all subjects of the empire were still enrolled in a system of ‘mutual security’ that was actually more about shared liability and mutual surveillance. Known under its Song dynasty variant of baojia, it grouped households into decimal units of a thousand (bao-) and a hundred (-jia), the latter being composed of ten groupings of ten households, and each unit having its own headman. Chosen by rotation, the headman was responsible for the good order and prompt compliance of his unit, rarely for the expression of its grievances; it was not a desirable post. The penal code made the headman and his unit liable not only for the conduct of its constituents but also for any crimes committed by them. Ideally the baojia grouping cut across the bonds of kinship, clan or professional association, and instilled a sense of equal and responsible participation in the machinery of government. But while in practice it might cement existing bonds, it did little to stem the exodus of the landless, and it often atrophied for want of support. Admirable as had been the attempts of the ‘Three Emperors’ to address the needs of their realm and placate their various constituents – Manchu, Mongol and Chinese – neither they nor their subjects had any concept of popular legitimacy. Government still relied on the penal code and the force of arms; Heaven’s judgement was the ultimate sanction, and the dynastic cycle the only guarantee of change.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All dynasties were doomed; the Qing would have fallen without foreign intervention; indeed, it lingered as long as it did only because of foreign intervention. But not perhaps the empire. While indigenous causes would topple the dynasty, it was extraneous forces which would cripple the empire.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A mere sideline in 1700, China soon proved a bonanza for the company. By 1770 the Guangzhou trade was the most important and lucrative in its considerable portfolio.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By the 1830s tea was contributing nearly 10 per cent of the British government’s entire revenue receipts.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The balance of trade throughout the eighteenth century was thus overwhelmingly in China’s favour. The Celestial Empire came to rely on this abundant source of silver, while British manufacturers and economists deplored the disregard of the national interest and what they called the ‘drain of specie’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In China home-grown opium, mainly for medicinal use, had been consumed, as it had in Europe, for at least a thousand years. But smoking it – rather than infusing or eating it – for the greater ‘hit’ nowadays classed as ‘recreational’ seems to have originated in Taiwan in the seventeenth century.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The habit spread to the mainland, where the Qing Yongzheng emperor made opium dens and opium dealing illegal but did not actually proscribe the drug.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"in 1773 the East India Company assumed monopoly control over poppy-growing and opium production in Bengal, about a thousand chests (60,000 kilograms, 60 tons) a year were reaching China. This figure had quadrupled by 1796, the year of the Qianlong emperor’s abdication and from which date, on orders from the Guangzhou authorities, the company stopped exporting its opium to China; ignoring the Chinese ban would have meant risking an embargo of its tea purchases, which was unthinkable.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Instead the company’s Indian opium crop was auctioned in Calcutta, purchased by private syndicates organised as ‘agency houses’, and then shipped by them to Guangzhou in still greater quantities.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Jiaqing emperor (successor of the Qianlong emperor; r. 1796–1821) introduced heftier penalties for smokers. He also banned opium imports altogether, which meant that it was now the turn of Guangzhou’s Co-hong merchants to forgo any overt involvement in the trade.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Singapore, acquired by the British in 1819 and developed as a free port, had attracted Chinese émigrés and a vast concourse of shipping; the opium trade there found the perfect entrepôt.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Echoing the exponential growth in Britain’s tea imports, China’s imports of Indian opium topped 13,000 chests in 1828 and had doubled again by 1836. By then, ‘total imports came to $18 million, making it the world’s most valuable single commodity trade of the nineteenth century’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The syndicates and agency houses that handled the shipments – mainly British but also American – looked to the company’s influence at Guangzhou for protection and made the proceeds of their trade available to the company for its tea purchases; it was the ideal way to convert – or launder – opium profits (and other perks of Eastern empire) into London stocks, country estates and parliamentary seats.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As of the late 1820s, therefore, foreign tea purchases no longer required an outlay of bullion; opium credits more than sufficed. Silver no longer flowed into China; it flowed out. By the 1830s it was flowing out at the rate of 9 million taels a year. The balance of trade had reversed. It was now imperial officials in Beijing who worried about the national interest and complained of ‘the drain of specie’. Within China, and especially in the south, the demand for silver pushed up its value against copper cash, causing the same distress as in Ming times among the cash-earning but silver-taxed classes. ‘Reduced growth, unemployment and urban unrest (another of the clusters of problems associated with dynastic decline) are directly attributable…to the sudden impact of this dramatic and disastrous shift in the balance of payments.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Many officials argued for legalisation, for a state monopoly and licensed dealers. As they saw it, prohibition had failed; penal deterrents were hard to enforce, and enforcers were too readily corrupted; both consumption and corruption could be better contained by punitive tariffs; these would also bring in substantial revenues; and state control would make the foreign traders more amenable to regulation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"measures to suppress both the trade and the habit. Lin Zexu, an able scholar and experienced administrator, stressed the moral aspect: opium addiction undermined the social relationships so essential to Confucian society. He accepted that addicts could not simply be executed. They must be encouraged to reform; treatment as well as penalties must be offered.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Commissioner Lin wasted no time. As well as propagandising, rounding up dealers and confiscating all opium pipes, he boldly targeted the foreign importers. Ordered to surrender all existing stocks of opium with no offer of compensation, they refused. A contemptuous 1,000 chests were offered, whereupon Commissioner Lin demanded that Lancelot Dent, a leading offender and head of one of the agency houses, must stand trial. If he was not handed over, Lin threatened to execute two Chinese merchants in his stead. Down at Macao Captain Charles Elliot, the new British superintendent, took this as ‘the immediate and inevitable’ prelude to war. Just like Napier, he called for reinforcements, sailed hastily up to Guangzhou, and was there blockaded. Meanwhile Dent had not been surrendered and Lin had therefore embargoed all trade. The commissioner still hoped to avoid war; but to the British it was seeming more desirable by the day.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He kept the emperor apprised of his triumphs; and more famously, employing a mix of reasoned argument, paternal exhortation, provocative bombast and bureaucratic rectitude, he wrote to Queen Victoria.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There were two letters; one was never sent, the other never arrived; but their tone and content were similar. ‘The Way of Heaven holds good for you as for us,’ Lin told the queen; all peoples are aware of what is good for them and what not; the Celestial Empire shares with others only its good things, such as rhubarb, tea and silk; but ‘a poisonous article is manufactured by certain devilish persons subject to your rule’ who ‘tempt the people of China to buy it’; Your Majesty, though surely in ignorance of your subjects’ involvement, must be aware of the drug’s harmful effects.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Our Heavenly Court’s resounding might…could at any moment control their [the opium traders’] fate; but in its compassion and generosity it gives due warning before it strikes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"For Waley, whose knowledge of written Chinese was unrivalled, translated the Chinese character rendered by the Pinyin word yi as ‘foreigner’, not as the pejorative ‘barbarian’. The equation of yi with ‘barbarian’ seems to have originated with a Pomeranian missionary who was serving the British as a translator at the time; it is not evident in earlier works, such as Macartney’s or Ricci’s journals. A small mistake perhaps, it surfaced in the run-up to the Opium War and gained a wide and notorious currency. The Chinese insisted that yi had always signified merely those non-Chinese peoples who were ‘easterners’ (the British frequented the east coast) – just as man did those who were ‘southerners’, rong ‘northerners’ and di ‘westerners’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"More even than opium, this tiny monosyllable poisoned diplomatic exchanges, and would require an article of its own – number 51 – in the 1858 Anglo-Chinese Treaty of Tianjin.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"A British equivalent would be substituting ‘wog’ for every mention of ‘foreign’ or ‘foreigners’ in the archives of the Public Record Office.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘Never has a lone word among the myriad languages of humanity made so much history as the Chinese character yi,’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the British, of all people, should not have been surprised by another nation’s presumption of moral superiority and international centrality.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In Lin’s first letter to Queen Victoria, it was hinted that the opium issue might be resolved by an offer to replace the drug with British or Indian imports of a less pernicious nature. As for protocol, the problem had already been resolved in respect of the Russians; equal status had been conceded in the treaties of Nerchinsk and Kiakhta, and trading arrangements, including regular Russian commercial missions to Beijing, had since been established.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"To obtain the treaty, the khan’s representatives had accepted China’s idiosyncratic attitude to foreign relations and conformed to tributary tradition. For the British, this was impossible – as impossible as it was for Commissioner Lin to disavow 2,000 years of managing neighbours, most of them predatory nomads, on the understanding that dialogue signified submission and that trade counted as tribute.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In Guangzhou, Commissioner Lin followed up his success in extracting opium from the foreigners by demanding that they sign bonds never again to carry the drug. On Elliot’s advice the British, as usual, refused. Lin then pressured the Portuguese into expelling them from Macao. Now baseless, Elliot and his countrymen sailed across the Pearl River estuary to a high and largely uninhabited island composed of uncultivable rock but with a sheltered anchorage. Its name they understood as ‘Hong Kong’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The fleet carried a letter from Palmerston to the Qing court that ‘demand[ed] from the Emperor satisfaction and redress for injuries inflicted by Chinese Authorities upon British subjects…and for insults offered by those same authorities to the British Crown’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Opium was mentioned in the letter; Palmerston conceded that Beijing had every right to ban it; but he contended that, since the ban was not rigorously enforced by Chinese officials, who were often complicit in breaking it, it was unfair to expect foreign suppliers to respect it – a logic from which smugglers the world over may have taken comfort.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But ten days later the fleet reappeared, this time off Zhoushan in Zhejiang. The city was heavily bombarded, forced to surrender and occupied. The fleet then continued north, round the Shandong peninsula and towards the mouth of the Beihe, the river on which Beijing lies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Commissioner Lin, who had totally misrepresented the strength of the enemy and had now exposed the capital to attack, was disgraced and sacked pending disposal.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The new Qing envoy and plenipotentiary, a provincial governor general called Qishan, talked the British into sailing back to Guangzhou on the understanding that he would there address their grievances in full. This he did to the extent that, with Guangzhou now at the mercy of Britain’s naval gunnery, an agreement was reached in January 1841: British superintendents at Guangzhou were to have access to Qing officials, Hong Kong was to be handed over, a $6 million indemnity paid, and trade to be reopened. In return the British were to leave Zhoushan.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But though the terms were immediately effective, the agreement was swiftly repudiated. The emperor was so horrified by the severity of the concessions, especially the cession of Hong Kong, that he now sacked Qishan, while Palmerston was so appalled by their leniency (no reimbursement for the destroyed opium, no new ports, only ‘a barren island’) that he too suspended his plenipotentiary.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In guns as in ships, the technological gap was not that great; Chinese yards and foundries would soon be turning out serviceable copies of anything the British could deploy. But the gulf between what pre-industrial China and post-industrial Europe made of the technology, and the confidence with which it was handled, was painful to contemplate. The only Qing seaborne counter-attack was a disaster; in a matter of days, seventy-one junks were destroyed and Guangzhou’s waterfront razed.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"After wintering and receiving more reinforcements, in 1842 the fleet proceeded up the Yangzi. Manchu Bannermen offered fierce resistance, the British bombardments were often indiscriminate, and there was much looting by both sides. But Shanghai was found undefended; Zhenjiang’s fall meant that the Grand Canal was severed; and Nanjing was saved only by a last-minute offer of negotiations.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Nanjing Treaty of 1842, while it left much for further discussion and recrimination, met the British demands and was ratified by both parties. The indemnity, now raised to $21 million and payable (plus interest) in instalments, would be a crippling burden on the empire’s shattered finances. Five ports, including Guangzhou and Shanghai (where a large ‘concession’ area was rapidly developed by, and exclusively for, the foreigners), were to be opened to both British trade and residency under the supervision of British consuls; Hong Kong stayed British; derogatory language as detected by Britain’s interpreters was outlawed; and opium was nowhere mentioned. In that the Chinese ban had been acknowledged by the British, the drug remained contraband; but in that the British had not forsworn the trade, the smuggling continued; indeed, it prospered greatly under the paternal gaze of the British navy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"With the mistaken idea that only by winning the support of competing nations could China hold the British in check, the Qing government signed treaties with the Americans and the French (and later other nations). Both these treaties included provision for missionary activity in China – Protestant Evangelical in the case of the Americans, Roman Catholic in the case of the French.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"was the American provision for treaty ‘modification’ after twelve years which would be invoked by the British in 1854 to ratchet up their requirements, including access to the Chinese interior and an ambassador in Beijing. Another war would back up these demands, and the inevitable concessions would follow. The so-called ‘Treaty System’ was thus a collaborative and progressive exercise in the diminution of China’s sovereignty through the appropriation of large sectors of its economy, its foreign relations, its society (in ‘the Treaty ports’ and concession areas) and its territory (in Hong Kong and later Manchuria and Xinjiang). Nanjing was just stage one.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Exposed by the outsiders, in less than a decade the empire faced rebellions within on a quite staggering scale.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Nearly all of China was affected by the rebellions. ‘Red Turban’ armies fighting for a Ming restoration (Ming pretenders were never in short supply) terrorised Guangdong in the mid-1850s. Muslim separatists took over Yunnan from 1855; other Muslim revolts plagued Shaanxi and Gansu from 1862.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But all these outbreaks were localised and little coordinated. They paled into insignificance beside the Taiping upheaval, ‘one of the great pivotal events of Chinese history’, or, as contemporary writers in both The Times and the North American Review had it, ‘the greatest revolution the world has yet seen’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Suffice it to say that, if the figures are even remotely accurate, more of the human race perished in the Taiping convulsion than in the First World War.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But like countless other aspiring examinees, he found this weight of expectation insupportable when failure greeted his attempts to pass the district examinations. He tried four times, and on one of them, when entering the Guangzhou examination compound, he was handed a loosely bound collection of tracts containing translated extracts from the Bible, a production of the London Missionary Society’s Singapore branch. Hong took it and put it aside for later reference. Unlike the Jesuits in the seventeenth century – those polymath padres who had directed their talents and their proselytising towards the court and officialdom – the Protestant missions operated at a lower social level. Rather than pursuing a doctrinal accommodation with Confucian tradition and pinning their hopes on the top-down conversion of an empire, they looked to the saving of individual souls and the refutation of heresy. The Word of God, carefully translated, widely disseminated and selflessly advertised by their own example, was deemed sufficient unto the task;\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Openly proclaiming his task, and proving an inspirational preacher, Hong converted Hakka friends and family in rural Guangdong and began destroying local shrines dedicated to Buddhist or Confucian worship.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But the Taipings opposed the Qing as the last in a long line of heretical alien dynasties; the clock should go back to AD 221.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What began as a migration turned into a crusade. The Taipings’ ‘Long March’ lasted over two years (1851–53) and took them from the obscurity of Guiping to centre stage in Nanjing. Sometimes compared to Moses’ Exodus or the Prophet’s hegira (hijra), in its military aspect the advance more obviously resembled the Arabs’ post-hegira jihad.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"March 1853 the ‘Heavenly King’ entered Nanjing in style, borne aloft in a golden palanquin and wearing the dragon robe of a Chinese emperor plus the tinsel crown of a Christian king.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In the case of the British, this was more like holding the Qing to ransom; for they had just tabled a demand for the revision of the 1842 treaty confident that the Taiping menace would find the Qing court at its most amenable.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Revision of the treaty meant rewriting it. Backed by the French and Americans, the British were now demanding more treaty ports, commercial access to the interior of China, a permanent ambassador in Beijing, the legalisation of the opium trade, the suppression of piracy and the lifting of internal transit dues. That was the first list; but as with the earlier treaty, cause was soon found to extend it. The interplay of negotiation and bombardment that ensued also closely resembled that which preceded the first treaty. Talks got under way but were suspended when in late 1856 a Chinese-owned but Hong Kong-based lorcha (small freighter) was suspected of piracy and seized by the Guangzhou authorities. The ship was called the Arrow and its legal status was highly debatable. But the incident was enough to ruffle British feathers and precipitate the ‘Arrow War’ (1856–60).\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Despite the demands of other wars in the Crimea and then India (the Great Rebellion or Mutiny), sufficient shipping was found for an Anglo-French task force. It stormed Guangzhou, captured and deported its governor, took over the city and then sailed north. In April/May 1858 the Anglo-French force took the Dagu forts at the mouth of the Beihe and reached Tianjin. Beijing was again at the foreigners’ mercy; and again the Qing capitulated.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The result was the punitive Treaty of Tianjin. With more insults to redress and more expenses to recoup, the British and French now imposed terms so heavy that one of their own negotiators considered them unreasonable. ‘We asked or rather dictated what…the Chinese could neither safely promise nor be fairly expected to perform.’26 Expanding and adding to the earlier list, the British and French demanded the opening of six new treaty ports, four in the hitherto closely guarded areas of Taiwan, Shandong and Manchuria. The Yangzi, and with it the richest provinces of the empire, was also to be opened to foreign trade as soon as the Taiping occupation permitted; and there were to be four treaty ports on the river, including Nanjing and Hankou. Travel in and around the treaty ports was to be unrestricted, and passports afforded to those who wished to go farther afield. Christian preachers were to be protected (it was attacks on Catholic missionaries which had provoked the French into participating in the task force); the new British ambassador in Beijing was to be accompanied by family and retainers and suitably accommodated; the noxious word yi was never again to be used of foreigners; and the import of opium, though its use was still banned, was legalised subject to a not unreasonable rate of duty.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Skilfully interposing themselves as intermediaries while promising secret support to the Qing, and taking every advantage of Qing weakness, the Russian delegates secured a treaty ‘that opened the entire northern frontier of the Qing empire, from Manchuria to Xinjiang, to Russia’s political and commercial influence’; moreover the subsequent demarcation of the Manchurian frontier awarded them all the territory north of the Heilongjiang and east of the Wusuli border.27 There, in due course, would be constructed Vladivostok, Russia’s only year-round Pacific port.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In Nanjing today, a Ming garden complex houses the little ‘Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Historical Museum’. Integration being the modern message, the exhibits and photographs tell less about the Taipings and more about those who suppressed them. Prominence goes to the dashing exploits of the Ever-Victorious and Unvanquished armies.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"who soon would be, were sent to Tokyo to sue for peace. In the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, the most humiliating in modern Chinese history, they had to accept an indemnity about five times that exacted by the Western allies in 1860, concede to Japan the whole of Taiwan, the Pescadores and Liaodong (the last later commuted for a further indemnity), open four new treaty ports, including Chongqing above the Yangzi gorges in Sichuan, and of course recognise Korea’s ‘full and complete’ independence – ‘which, under the circumstances, effectively made Korea a Japanese protectorate’.9 Li Hongzhang’s reputation never entirely recovered.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By 1898, such was the competition between the foreign powers, and such internally the centrifugal drift of authority to the provinces, that there was a real danger of China sharing Africa’s fate and being scrambled over and partitioned.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"They also leased more of the Kowloon peninsula – Hong Kong’s so-called New Territories – to supply and secure that colony; and as of Lord Curzon’s 1899 appointment as Viceroy of India, they opened a new front by asserting commercial interests in Tibet and demanding a frontier demarcation there;\"\n\n---------\n\n\"While Cixi was enjoying a summer retreat in one of her new palaces, the emperor held long consultations with Kang Youwei, a renowned scholar who had been behind the students’ 1895 memorial, and then dramatically issued a whole string of modernising edicts. Known as the ‘Hundred Days’ reforms’, they were comprehensive enough. A vast range of educational, military, administrative and economic innovations were announced, designed to overhaul the entire state apparatus and turn Confucian bureaucrats into Confucian technocrats. But constitutional reform was notably absent; representation was not mentioned, nor was any limitation of the imperial prerogatives. Whether such initiatives would have followed is uncertain, for three months later Cixi staged a comeback. A hundred days having been just long enough for a bureaucratic reaction to set in and military indifference to be evident, she drew up an edict in the emperor’s name that requested the dowager empress to resume her duties immediately. This she then dutifully did, having the emperor cast into palace detention and having six of his leading advisers executed. The reforms died with them, though Kang Youwei escaped to Japan from where Sun Yat-sen was now extending his web of intrigue to mainland China. As so often in the coming years, the great breakthrough had proved deceptive. Instead of advancing the cause of the reform, it had retarded it, provoking the removal of its leadership and cowing moderate opinion.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In late 1899 what history calls the Boxer Rebellion broke out in Shandong. The trouble rapidly spread through Hebei, Shanxi and part of Henan, where many foreigners, mostly missionaries, were massacred. In the summer of 1900, it engulfed Tianjin and Beijing, and resulted in their expatriate communities (including women and children), along with several thousand mainly Christian Chinese, being besieged, often under heavy fire, in their legations and in the grounds of one of Beijing’s Catholic cathedrals. Highly coloured reports that the Beijing contingent had all been massacred provoked an international outcry; and though the reports proved to be incorrect, the besieged did suffer about seventy fatalities, some deprivation and much trauma. The Beijing siege lasted fifty-five days. It was lifted when a 20,000-strong multinational force retook Tianjin and fought its way up to the capital; both cities were then comprehensively pillaged by the foreigners. Among the besieged in the Beijing legations had been the American sinologist Dr W. A. P. Martin and Sir (as he now was) Robert Hart of the Imperial Customs.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Cixi and her reactionary advisers bided their time. The Boxers posed no threat to the dynasty. Reform was not on their agenda; rather would they ‘Support the Qing, Destroy the Foreigner’. Their entry into Beijing therefore went unopposed and their assaults on foreigners unpunished. When, however, Beijing’s foreign diplomats refused an imperial request that, for their own safety, they evacuate the city and withdraw to the coast, Cixi began to view the Boxers as potential liberators from the alien presence. And when a precautionary allied capture of the Dagu forts protecting Tianjin provoked a Qing declaration of war, there could be no question that the Boxers had imperial backing.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Thus it was that under the terms of the Boxer Protocol, in return for the largest of all indemnities (payable over forty years from increased maritime customs), for the execution of ten officials deemed guilty of crimes and for various measures to secure the foreign legations in the future, Cixi and the court were permitted to reoccupy the capital and resume the government.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Japanese model of modernisation also had much to recommend it. There the monarchy continued to be revered but had been reduced to constitutional status by the introduction of a parliamentary structure. Land tenure had been reformed, education redirected and heavy industries developed. ‘Rich Country, Strong Army’ being the slogan, a centralised government had forged national solidarity by giving the highest priority to the economy and the military. It had paid off in the Sino-Japanese war over Korea in 1894, and it was vindicated again when in 1904–5 a Russo-Japanese war broke out over concessions in both Korea and Manchuria. The Japanese navy destroyed the Russian fleet much as it had the Chinese ten years earlier; an Asian country thus notched up its first victory over a European empire; and Japan won recognition as one of the great powers.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Tibet was now effectively independent. Though this independence was never recognised by any Chinese government, in 1913 President Yuan Shikai did acknowledge Tibetan autonomy in return for British recognition of the Chinese republic.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"suzerainty in return for China accepting Tibet’s autonomy. This satisfied neither party and would have been difficult to implement. But the formula was maintained until 1949, when independent India’s Jawaharlal Nehru indicated that he was not inclined to ‘a legalistic view’ of the matter. Mao Zedong took the hint and thereupon made the ‘liberation’ of Tibet a priority for the People’s Liberation Army. It was invaded within the year and secured as an integral, if autonomous, region of the People’s Republic. The XIVth Dalai Lama tolerated this situation until 1959. In that year the Tibetans rose against the Chinese presence, the army returned to suppress the revolt and His Holiness fled to India, this time indefinitely.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Sun Yat-sen’s Revolutionary Alliance, now renamed the Guomindang (National People’s Party) and with its strongest support in the south, had won China’s first election in 1913. (About 40 million had the vote, although women were still not among them.) Yuan Shikai, his prior election as president doubtful after this Nationalist victory and his strongest support being in the north, then moved against the Guomindang and attacked provincial governors who supported it. Heavier fighting than usual followed, and the northern forces stormed and ransacked Nanjing. The parliament was dissolved, Sun fled back into exile and Yuan Shikai ruled as dictator, even attempting to set himself up as emperor, until his death in 1916.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Inspired by the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and by Chinese students who had taken up Marxism-Leninism while on work-study programmes in Paris, the CCP had been formed in Shanghai in 1921. Mao Zedong attended this first convention as Hunan’s representative, while Chen Duxiu, editor of the leftist journal New Youth and founder of several Marxist study groups, was chosen as secretary-general. Links with Lenin’s Comintern (Communist International) had already been established, and they were cemented when the Russian leadership indicated a willingness to restore to a legitimate Chinese government all Russian concessions in China. Here clearly was a highly desirable ally in the struggle to liberate the country from the foreign imperialists.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The strikers, and the CCP, then became the victims of a flagrant and never-to-be forgotten betrayal. Chiang needed the recognition of the foreign powers, the forbearance of their navies and the loans and exactions available from Shanghai’s banks and corporations. He did not need ardent supporters bent on ousting the foreign imperialists and reclaiming their concessions while using organised labour to smash the power of the corporate bourgeoisie. In short, the CCP was now an embarrassment.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Chiang Kai-shek launched an all-out assault on the labour unions. Hundreds of union leaders were gunned down, thousands arrested. Similar acts of repression followed in Wuhan and Guangzhou. The CCP’s hopes of a Marxist revolution based on the seizure of the means of production by the industrial proletariat had always been a long shot in an overwhelmingly agrarian economy. Now those hopes were dashed.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since priority was being given to eradicating the CCP, extending Nationalist control into the warlord-ruled countryside and milking Shanghai for funds, ‘there was little need for Chiang to worry about the trappings of democracy’.21 A strongly centralist and bureaucratic form of administration was adopted by China’s first Nationalist government, and an austere Confucianist ideology developed to underpin it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When in the 1930s Chiang conceived an admiration for Hitler and Mussolini, it acquired fascist undertones. The now Generalissimo became the centre of a personal cult and launched his own morality police, the ‘Blueshirts’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"With a legitimate and reasonably stable government in place, ‘the first British surrender of crown territory since the American War of Independence’ took place in October 1930. The ceremonial procedure adopted for the occasion – handshakes, flag-lowering, salutes, bagpipes, sombre seaward departure, ecstatic landward celebrations – would be repeated in outposts of Britain’s empire at the rate of about one every two years over the next half-century.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Since its betrayal by the Guomindang in 1928, the CCP had gone back to the countryside. In several scattered enclaves, the party slowly reformed, usually following an accommodation with local warlords, and then began establishing autonomous local soviets, still with Comintern guidance and support. Troops were recruited and trained; and the leadership was viciously contested. Chen Duxiu and Qu Qiubai had been made scapegoats for the failure of the united front with the Guomindang, despite their reservations about it in the first place.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Other figures now contended for high party office. They included: Zhou Enlai, a dedicated ideologue who had studied in Paris, then headed the political department of the Guangdong military academy, and now coordinated party activities; Lin Biao, one of the Guangdong Academy’s cadets who had distinguished himself as a brilliant commander during the first phase of the Northern Expedition; and Mao Zedong, a tall, slightly effete-looking maverick with little military experience, an unreliable record, a ruthless reputation and an unshakeable conviction that he alone understood the requirements of the situation.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The largest ‘Red’ enclave was located in the hills of Jiangxi near the provincial border with Hunan. When, in 1934, this Jiangxi soviet was faced with imminent extinction, the decision was taken to evacuate it. About 28,000, including the wounded and nearly all the women, were left behind to the none-too-tender mercies of the Nationalists; equal status did not include equal opportunity of survival. The rest, about 80,000, of whom perhaps half were combat troops, broke out of the blockade under cover of darkness, heading west, on 16 October 1934. This was the start of the ‘Ten-thousand Li [about 5,000 kilometres, 3,000 miles] March’, otherwise the Long March.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘The most enduring myth in modern Chinese history, and one of the biggest myths of the twentieth century’, the Long March has since been controversially exposed as just that, a myth.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"According to Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Mao was very nearly left behind; he repeatedly led the marchers astray; and like the rest of the leadership, he seldom actually marched, being carried most of the way in a sedan chair.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Chiang’s son was at the time in Russia and supposedly being detained there as surety for his father’s collaboration. Were Chiang’s forces to annihilate the marchers, it would be as good as a death sentence for one on whom his father doted. Additionally Chiang could not afford to antagonise Moscow at a time when Tokyo posed the direr threat.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Comintern wanted the Jiangxi ‘Reds’ to relocate in the north-west, where they could supply and control them. Chiang’s task, therefore, was to shepherd them there. Instead of decimating the communists, he was to deliver them.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The battles of the march were invention, its year-long duration was due to quite unnecessary diversions, and the hardships encountered were the result of Mao’s miscalculations and his power-thirsty manoeuvrings.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Removing from southern Jiangxi to northern Shaanxi, while saving the CCP from possible extinction and proving a strategic masterstroke, lent the party national credibility and set an example of improbable, even heaven-blest, survival.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In China, from the Han founder Liu Bang’s repeated withdrawals before the fiery Xiang Yu to the long northward march of the Taipings, precedents aplenty demonstrated the genius of tactical relocation. And while to the average Chinese the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism may have seemed excessively abstract and alien, the march gave them a human dimension and a national relevance.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Worse by far, though, was the madness that had overtaken the Japanese when they entered Nanjing. That city, as fair as any with its graceful Ming palaces and massive walls beneath the wooded slopes of Mount Zijin, had known massacres before. Nothing, though, could compare with the butchery, rapes and other atrocities perpetrated over a seven-week reign of terror in the winter of 1937/38. As Japanese troops took their revenge on the capital, at least 50,000 Chinese – and possibly half a million – most of them civilians, were gratuitously slaughtered in one of the worst war crimes on record.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The communists, joined by local partisans and some Koreans, were allowed to help themselves to the stockpiled Japanese weaponry and establish themselves in the far north. It was thus in Harbin, the first city run by the CCP, that Lin Biao reorganised his forces as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and in late 1946 began to push south.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"‘The greatest obstacle to peace has been the complete, almost overwhelming suspicion with which the Chinese Communist Party and the Guomindang regard each other,’ began General George Marshall’s report on the failure of his mediating mission. ‘They each sought only to take counsel of their fears.’\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The communists no longer disguised their revolutionary intent. Lands were confiscated and redistributed, landowners held to account, informants encouraged, and mass indoctrination campaigns organised. The Nationalists, on the other hand, betrayed their old preference for corporate croneyism, indifference to popular sentiment and economic incompetence. A collapse in morale as a result of rampant inflation (500 per cent a month in 1948), famines, rural unrest and student protests undermined the Nationalist regime more fatally than the communist victories.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"By 1948 the PLA had inflicted a series of disastrous defeats on the Nationalists in Manchuria, leading to mass desertions. All over northern China the CCP’s peasant guerrillas were simultaneously making the countryside a no-go area.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"He certainly considered standing firm south of the Yangzi, while he investigated the alternative possibility of again withdrawing to Sichuan and Yunnan. But in the end he opted for the greater safety of Taiwan, which had been restored to the republic after the defeat of Japan. Art treasures and texts from the Imperial Palace in Beijing, the nearest thing to regalia that he could lay his hands on, were removed there in 1948; and in early 1949, as the PLA overran the south in a series of lightning advances, Chiang himself fled across the Taiwan Strait with about a million of his troops. Other Nationalists were driven into Thailand, Laos and Burma. Many emigrated overseas.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"As president of his rump ‘Republic of China’, Chiang ruled on in Taiwan until his death in 1975. In good dynastic tradition he was then succeeded by his son until Taiwan adopted a parliamentary form of government in the late 1980s.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1976 it acquired a positively insidious dimension when on 4–5 April a display of Qingming floral wreaths and poster poems brought crowds of mourners to Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. They were protesting against official indifference to the recent death of Premier Zhou Enlai, which they saw as disparagement of a revered and long-serving revolutionary by the hard left leadership of the Cultural Revolution. Cars were overturned and a police post torched. But the main casualty was Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping; accused of orchestrating the affair, he was dismissed from all his Party offices. Sometimes known as the Tiananmen incident, this 1976 protest is now more commonly called the Qingming Incident, so avoiding confusion with the more prolonged Tiananmen confrontation of 1989.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Reviled as late as the 1970s, in the 1990s Confucius had been rehabilitated. Confucian injunctions were now eclipsing the slogans of both Marxism-Leninism and ‘Mao Zedong thought’ in official discourse.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Pride in those 3000–6000 years of continuous civilisation, rather than the recent achievements of the proletariat, had been chosen as the theme of the Beijing Olympics.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"China has transformed itself – and is still doing so – more dramatically than any other region in the world. In fact the rate of change is so fast that it wrong-foots all but the most agile China-watchers.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Because so many Maoist achievements were quickly discredited, there then arose a tendency to gloss over all those initiatives that had loomed largest at the time – Soviet collaboration, agricultural collectivisation, industrialisation, the Great Leap and the Cultural Revolution – in favour of a narrative buoyed by the incidence of liberalising interludes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"It supposes a progressive ‘opening up’ that was not self-evident at the time, and it foreshadows an ultimate liberalisation – including multiparty politics, electoral accountability, freedom of expression, and legal redress – that is far from assured.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When on 1 October 1949 the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was officially announced by Mao in Beijing, the People’s Liberation Army had much liberating still to do. Guangdong had yet to be reached (it fell two weeks later); Tibet and Xinjiang, comprising nearly half of the erstwhile empire’s landmass, aspired to qualified independence; the British were back in Hong Kong; and from Taiwan, alienated by the relocation there of Chiang Kai-shek’s still internationally recognised Republic of China, a reinvasion of the mainland remained a distinct possibility.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Regardless of such fine distinctions, China and the USA were effectively at war in Korea from 1950 until 1953.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In December 1949, on his first ever trip outside China, Mao took the train to Moscow. There Stalin, basking in the cult of his own personality while tyrannising both people and Party, encouraged Mao’s autocratic tendencies without overindulging his revolution.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In return for international solidarity, secret recognition of Moscow’s strategic interests in Xinjiang and Manchuria, and various raw materials, Mao secured a promise of support in the event of war, a $300 million loan (half to be used for military purchases), and the know-how and personnel to set up fifty state-owned heavy industrial complexes.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This Soviet support did nothing to advance Beijing’s claims to Taiwan or Hong Kong; but it did facilitate the reintegration of regions once contested by Russia,\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Thanks to Soviet links with India, it also silenced some of the international disquiet over the reclamation of Tibet.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Trained Party activists descended on village after village, identified and classified all households, incited the denunciation of those designated ‘rich landlords’, and, having dispossessed and disposed of these ‘enemies of the people’, redistributed their property among the landless. A million or more landowners and counter-revolutionaries may have been executed in this first phase of retributive justice; Mao himself would put the death toll at 700,000. But several hundred million peasants found themselves beneficiaries of the redistribution as, for the first time, they tilled their own fields and reaped the fruits of their labour.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"In 1955, rid of the Korean War and still on good terms with the Soviets, Mao addressed this problem personally by calling for an immediate acceleration in the pace of agrarian revolution. Cooperatives were now to be amalgamated into larger collectives. Land and implements would be collectively owned, the peasant’s only input being labour and only reward a share of the collective’s produce based on a complicated calculation of the ‘work points’ earned by each individual.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"With Party encouragement, by 1957 some districts were taking the process a stage farther. Just as cooperatives had been merged into the larger collectives, so now collectives were being merged into the still larger communes. Mao endorsed the move with an exhortation for all production to be ‘larger, faster, better, cheaper’. Any privately owned plots that had survived collectivisation were now incorporated in the communised land area. With a work force of 20,000–100,000, a commune required an administrative infrastructure that, besides doling out work points and drumming in slogans, offered services likely to keep the existing workforce in good shape and augment it by freeing up women otherwise detained at home. Organised\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The 1950s would later be remembered as Maoist China’s ‘golden age’ – a comparative verdict, obviously – with the early phase of communisation being especially cherished as the ‘eat it up’ period.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Mao had conjured up visions of a socialist paradise with peace and plenty for all; sure enough, for a few months in early 1957, this ‘great harmony’ (da tong – he used the Confucian term) seemed imminent.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Even the barriers to freedom of expression were being lowered as dissidents and scholars were encouraged to speak their minds. This was another of Mao’s ideas. In policy-making as in dialectics, he was fascinated by contradiction, by how friction sparked innovation, conflict generated endeavour, revolution validated authority. Order arose from chaos; but without more chaos, it would atrophy.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Both meadow and field were hastily ploughed under. Springtime’s ‘great harmony’ lasted only weeks. ‘The hundred flowers’ bloomed in unacceptable shades of opinion and ‘the hundred schools’ contended much too contentiously; they even debated the defiance that had just been silenced in Hungary by Soviet tanks. By summer 1957 all those who had been rash enough to speak out were rounded up. Mao pretended that exposing and then purging these ‘rightist’ elements had been the plan all along. Whether true or not, it now seemed that nothing could be taken at its face value when viewed through the looking-glass of Maoism. A new unease permeated the Party and extended down through the ranks of the administration; to deluded ambitions born of extravagant idealism were added servile compliance and duplicity born of the terror of disapproval.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Mobilising the masses to torment sparrows, mice and other grain-eating vermin had supposedly boosted the harvest; just so, mobilising the masses to turn pig iron into steel would boost industry.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Fantastic production targets were set, and, if the quality was ignored and the returns believed, were nearly met. Thanks to a traditional technology – the blast furnace had probably been pioneered in Henan in the third century BC – China would become a world-class economy in one ‘great leap forward’.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Instead of grinding through the geared stages of growth laid down in the Marxist-Leninist manual – heavy industry first, then mechanisation, collectivisation, and eventually state ownership of all the means of production – Mao revved the engine and let fly the clutch.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"But already there were rumours of famine; the reports were suppressed, the observers silenced. Instead of an investigation, the communes were favoured with a new wave of young urban ideologues intent on teaching the peasants how to grow corn, albeit ‘larger, faster, better, cheaper’. Their innovations and naivety contributed to the impending disaster. Procurement quotas for 1959 had been set at hopelessly unrealistic levels; even without the drought of that year, the cold and rains of the next, and the inevitable Yellow River flood, the state’s requisitions could be met only at the expense of the communal kitchens. There meals became fewer, weeds replaced vegetables, and muddy water was passed off as soup. The severity of the famine varied – from serious in the cities to acute in some provinces, absolute in others. Talk of cannibalism and of graziers eating their own grass was dismissed as mischievous; the bountiful reports still emanating from the local cadres belied it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"So wheat continued to be exported while those who grew it grazed on grass.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"And so, in an age when roads and railways should have made relief a formality, nothing was done. Alleviating conditions meant admitting the disaster; but since the leadership and its policies were beyond criticism, those responsible must be incompetent or reactionary elements within the communes. In effect, whistle-blowers merely denounced themselves. Prudence dictated signing off on the fictitious production figures and keeping quiet.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"How many victims were claimed by the famine of 1958–61 will never be known. It was certainly the twentieth century’s worst. From the pattern of population growth for the period, statisticians have extrapolated a catch-all figure of 20–30 million. Half may have actually starved to death; the rest were circumstantial victims. Minor diseases proved fatal to the enfeebled; the old died younger and the young failed to replace them. Aborted, stillborn and short-lived babies were probably exceeded by the millions who were simply never conceived, abstinence and infertility being concomitants of malnutrition. Communes turned into death camps.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The Great Leap Forward occasioned a catastrophic lurch backward.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Thus, failing to adapt, or ‘not changing with the times’, was a flaw common to many dynastic founders. Mao was exceptional in just two respects: he lasted longer than most, so multiplying his potential for mischief, and he discovered a rationale for prolonging the mischief that masked his mere love of power. This lay in his belief that constant turmoil and class struggle were essential to the integrity of the revolution, which would otherwise be undermined by inertia, corruption and ideological backsliding. It did not occur to him that the revolution might also be undermined by histrionic efforts to perpetuate it.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"When the enormity of the Great Leap tragedy could no longer be concealed, Mao invoked a less hands-on imperial tradition, that of the wuwei (aloof or ‘inactive’) ruler. He withdrew from public view, surrendered the chairmanship of the PRC (though not of the Party), and secluded himself in various favoured retreats. ‘The great helmsman’ was thus below decks when the ship hit the rocks, although he surfaced for Party gatherings and would later accept that mistakes had been made during the Great Leap.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Liu Shaoqi, a fine-looking and capable bureaucrat whom Mao had installed as head of state and his preferred successor (dynastic preference trumped egalitarian principle in such matters), conducted a Socialist Education Campaign that found corruption and impropriety to be endemic in the Party, the provincial administrations and the state industries. The resultant arrests ran into the hundreds of thousands.\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/01d157b6-ddeb-4555-b8b3-b3f87c8723c4.html","relUrl":"notes/01d157b6-ddeb-4555-b8b3-b3f87c8723c4.html"},{"doc":"Chaos Monkeys: Inside the Silicon Valley Money Machine","title":"Chaos Monkeys: Inside the Silicon Valley Money Machine","hpath":"kindle_highlights.chaos_monkeys","content":"\n\"Here’s the lesson: when the company’s employee retention strategy is cultivating Stockholm syndrome, you’re in the wrong company.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"What is writing?

In practice, the technical stuff is easy, unless you’re incompetent or really at the hairy edge of human knowledge—for example, putting a man on Mars. No, every real problem in startups is a people problem, and as such they’re the hardest to solve, as they often don’t have a real solution, much less a ready software fix.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This was a bad idea. In general, either the CEO or the smooth-tongued founder designated for the purpose should be involved in the fund-raising, and that person alone.

Their employees are mercenaries who don’t deeply care, and suffer from the diffuse responsibility and weak emotional investment of a larger organization. What’s an existential struggle to you is merely one more set of tasks to a tuned-out engineer bored of his own product, or another legal hassle to an already overworked legal counsel thinking more about her next stock-vesting date than your suit.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Also, large companies have valuable public brands they must delicately preserve, and which can be assailed by even small companies such as yours, particularly in a tight-knit, appearances-conscious ecosystem like that of Silicon Valley.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Cash, as always, is the poor man’s credit.

In that sense, he was the absolute exemplar of your successful startup CEO, even if not in the way people commonly think.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The tech startup scene, for all its pretensions of transparency, principled innovation, and a counterculture renouncement of pressed shirts and staid social convention, is actually a surprisingly reactionary crowd.

It certainly isn’t intelligence. I was in the lower third of my PhD class in physics at Berkeley, and I had to take my preliminary exams three times before I passed. Most of the founders I know are certainly crafty and quick-witted, but compared with some of the certified geniuses I met in academia, they aren’t going to win any Fields Medals or Nobels. It certainly isn’t technical skill. I’m a crappy programmer, and I can hack crude prototypes of finished products at best. Some founders are technical virtuosos, but I suspect most weren’t the top students in their respective computer science classes (assuming they even had a formal education). It’s not unique product or market vision. Anyone who used Google’s ads-buying tool for all of five minutes, and then registered that that piece of shit was a $70 billion per year money-maker, could see the need for AdGrok. Some startup ideas were visionary, like Airbnb, but many, like Dropbox, were merely extremely well executed versions of existing technologies. In my limited experience, there are two traits that distinguish successful startup founders at whatever level of the game, from the forgettably minuscule (e.g., AdGrok) to the epoch changing (e.g., SpaceX). First, the ability to monomaniacally and obsessively focus on one thing and one thing only, at the expense of everything else in life. I lived, breathed, and shat AdGrok. Thanks to focusing on AdGrok, I watched my daughter grow up through the frame of a Skype window while I was in AdGrok’s Mountain View shit hole. I had no social life outside of schmooze-and-booze tech events, at which I would wear my AdGrok T-shirt and engage in techno small talk with people I didn’t really care about. I had no hobbies or outside activities of any kind, except very occasional trips to the gym. My sailboat, into which I had poured two years of money and weekends to restore, slowly rotted in the sun. I never read anything except the tech press. Movies were out of the question. The ladies? While I was nominally still in a relationship with British Trader, my penis was anatomically equivalent to my coccyx: a purposeless vestige of a bygone era. Second, the ability to take and endure endless amounts of shit. I was raised under the sadistic care of a sister ten years my senior who delighted in unleashing endless taunts and abuses. My father was a domineering man, in every way. I spent years in an all-boys Catholic school filled with brutish bullies and cold, aloof priests. We did nothing but beat each other up and jerk off. I scraped by on nothing for six years as a penniless grad student in an expensive city, and then survived three years on Wall Street’s most competitive trading floor during its biggest market catastrophe. Long story short: within the limited purview of white-collar travails, there’s nothing I can’t take for an extended period of time.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The tech press, even more so than the regular press, willingly covered only births, deaths, weddings, and bloody accidents: that is, a new funding round, a startup’s collapse (the messier the better), acquisitions, or a nasty scandal, like a founder conflict or a sexual harassment claim.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Fortunately, the iteration cycle in a software business is fast (we don’t need to retool milling machines here), and from some approximately correct starting point we can converge on a final product, almost like successive guesses at the solution to an equation. The quicker we iterate, the more steps we can take in the direction of this mythical point of perfect fit. Each such step costs money in wages, server costs, and lost time. When that cash balance goes to zero, the game is over and we’ve lost. If, however, we get close enough to that perfect product-market fit, in which users pay more money for the product than it costs to operate (and than it cost to acquire those users to begin with), we’ve escaped the financial free fall.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Walking into any meeting, you should know every goddamn thing there is to know about the other person; if you don’t, you’re failing.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Quoth Emerson and the intro screen to Mortal Kombat 3: “There is no knowledge that is not power,”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Leaving at precisely four years means they’re plodders, punching the equivalent of the white-collar Silicon Valley clock until the next shift.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Did they trudge along on the upper-class tour bus from the Ivy League to consulting and/or finance and burn out, or did they fight their way out of some backwater, earning their seat at the table based only on chutzpah and/or blitzkrieg-style success?

You’ll need every advantage you can get.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The risk expectations of founders and investors can often be severely misaligned. I hate sports analogies, but here’s one to explain this vital point: most VCs are playing a version of baseball in which the only way to score is to hit a home run when you’re at bat. They don’t care if you disgrace or impoverish yourself and strike out, and they don’t care if you get a solid line drive that lands you on second. To them, strikeouts and getting on base are equally pointless, and so they’ll push to proverbially “swing for the fences” no matter the count or the team you’re up against.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Truth in the world resides only in mathematical proofs and physics labs.

When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.fn1 This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent.10 The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”11 Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.

The costs of your bad habits are in the future.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”9 Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. There can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, “Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.20 In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining, and 4 years as a wild success.”2\"\n\n---------\n\n\"“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?” He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.” His answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking about work ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"All you have to do is hit the gym a few days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time and letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much. Things are going well. It’s easy to rationalize taking a day off because you’re in a good place.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”6\"\n\n---------\n\n\"There have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like finishing, but I’ve never regretted doing the workout.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—not improving them. In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time.1\"\n\n---------\n\n\"One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.”10 The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail. —LAO TZU\"\n\n---------\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/lhTMgWPIZasNjtzWgkfFg.html","relUrl":"notes/lhTMgWPIZasNjtzWgkfFg.html"},{"doc":"The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to learn","title":"The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to learn","hpath":"kindle_highlights.art_of_doing_science_and_engineering","content":"\n\"We must abandon the guided tour through the art gallery of mathematics, and instead teach how to create the mathematics we need.\"\n\n---------\n\n\"the close, deliberate examination of everyone and everything, from the choice of complex exponentials as basis functions to the number of jokes in an after-dinner speech.

The HEAD of `production` is\nwhat the site was running at any moment. People made pull requests based off `master`, stuff got merged into `master`\nand _eventually_ got released.\n\nEach release required merging master into production. However, there may have been hotfixes to production in the meanwhile\nas well. So what we ended up doing to bring master and production into sync was:\n\n1. Merge `master` into `production`.\n2. Deploy the `production` branch.\n3. Merge `production` back into `master`.\n\nThe time between releases could be months! The commit difference between master and production\nwas often in the order of hundreds. This made releases painful and we had to be extra careful. If there\nwas a schema change involved, that made things even more complicated.\n\n## After\n\nThe change that we made is merging stuff into master as often as possible. And as soon as it's merged, release\nthe changes into production. This set up a decent pipeline where each release consisted of a small number of pull requests,\nmaking it much easier to release stuff.\n\nOver the last 3 months, we've done 33 releases (almost 3 deploys a week), which account for ~400 commits.\n\nThere have been a number of advantages to this approach. The deployer doesn't feel as concerned releasing 1 small pull\nrequest vs releasing 100 huge pull requests merged into master a few months ago. It also sets up a quick feedback loop\nfor the developer who gets to see their changes working in real life as soon as their pull request gets merged.\n\nGiven our engineering capacity, this new method of releasing stuff often has really helped in making ListenBrainz\na more active project.\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/27869ad9-d1bc-4585-b57c-8a8450f37c1b.html","relUrl":"notes/27869ad9-d1bc-4585-b57c-8a8450f37c1b.html"},{"doc":"Interview","title":"Interview","hpath":"engineering.interview","content":"\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/fcd3feab-8fa6-4ab0-b8ae-5ce300bf9331.html","relUrl":"notes/fcd3feab-8fa6-4ab0-b8ae-5ce300bf9331.html"},{"doc":"Intercom project","title":"Intercom project","hpath":"engineering.interview.intercom_project","content":"\nCame across this when Vijaya was interviewing with Intercom.\n\nIntercom asks you to write code for a project called \"minicom\".\n\nhttps://github.com/intercom/minicom-public\n\nQuite interesting, and I think possibly a better alternative to \"Bug Squash\" interviews\nthat Stripe does, although I guess bug squash gives more signal for debugging that someone\nwriting their own code.

For each phase, make sure that both you and students know a success criteria.\n\n- Make sure that the project has a reasonable conclusion period.\n\n- Give feedback early. Don't let pull requests linger.\n\n- Set up regular meeting times. Don't flake on the meetings.\n\n- Plan. Make sure that you and the student are aligned on what you're expecting to get done regularly. I have found\n  a weekly planning meeting to work well, but I think other timeframes could work too.\n\n- Try to make sure the student doesn't get distracted.\n\n- Keep the student accountable. If they're falling behind, ask them why and try to resolve blockers early.\n\n- Don't micro-manage.\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/3ef975da-c18f-45b4-a95f-532c7d20d83f.html","relUrl":"notes/3ef975da-c18f-45b4-a95f-532c7d20d83f.html"},{"doc":"Crypto","title":"Crypto","hpath":"crypto","content":"\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/7bd30489-ac80-49b9-86a5-57d3004fdadf.html","relUrl":"notes/7bd30489-ac80-49b9-86a5-57d3004fdadf.html"},{"doc":"a16z crypto startup school","title":"a16z crypto startup school","hpath":"crypto.a16z_startup_school","content":"\nhttps://a16z.com/crypto-startup-school/\n\n## Notes\n\n* [[Lecture 1 - Crypto Networks and Why They Matter | crypto.a16z_startup_school.crypto_networks_and_why_they_matter]]\n* [[Lecture 2 - Blockchain Primitives | crypto.a16z_startup_school.blockchain_primitives]]\n* [[Lecture 4 - Crypto Applications | crypto.a16z_startup_school.crypto_applications]]\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/iUIm6UQGbacPjlRf8BeKC.html","relUrl":"notes/iUIm6UQGbacPjlRf8BeKC.html"},{"doc":"Chris Dixon -  Crypto Networks and Why They Matter","title":"Chris Dixon -  Crypto Networks and Why They Matter","hpath":"crypto.a16z_startup_school.crypto_networks_and_why_they_matter","content":"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wxtiNgXBaU\n\n* Crypto develops in cycles that appear chaotic but there is an underlying order.\n* People come in because of trading, start to get interested, have new ideas and create new startups/projects.\n* Developer activity gets sustained even if the price goes down.\n* Each cycle the design space widens a bit.\n* Normally think of price as a lagging indicator, but it's weird in crypto. Price feeds back into the fundamentals.\n* Waves of interest and activity.\n\n* Blockchain with a token can be generalized to a lot of things.\n* Every 10-15 years, there is a new era of computing platforms.\n* **Blockchains are a new type of computer**.\n* System like ethereum provides a way to store data and operate on that data.\n* Blockchain -- A virtual computer that runs on top of a network of physical computers that provides strong auditable guarantees that the code it runs will continue to operate as designed.\n* Any other computer pre-blockchain, either you own the computer or renting it. No trust.\n* Blockchain subverts the governance.\n* Establishes trust in a way that doesn't exist in current way\n* *Computers that can make commitments.*\n* Bitcoin commitments\n  * Fixed supply\n  * No double spend\n  * Your bitcoin is yours\n* Anything else before bitcoin needed you to trust government or scarcity of precious metals.\n\n## Blockchain computers - Architecture\n\n### Nodes\n\nNodes are the method by which anyone - without needing permission - can join the network and become part of the computer.\n\nEach node runs code required to make the system function. Nodes are incentivized to behave honestly, but the consensus mechanism\nenforces correct operation of the entire computer even if a significant number of nodes misbehave.\n\n### Consensus mechanism\n\nThe consensus mechanism aggregates the \"votes\" from the node and determines the correct operation of the blockchain computer.\n\nThe rounds of voting are broken into blocks which are then chained together. A well designed consensus mechanism gives mathematically\nprovable guarantees about the trustworthiness of the computer as a whole.\n\n### Memory and operations\n\n\n## The result: trust guarantees\n\nThe trust guarantees of the computer gives you ability to build credible things you couldn't with old computers. Digital money, digital goods,\nDAOs. Vote on twitter or facebook to decide the rules of the platform, the privacy of the data etc. Currently it's in the control of random PMs in\nsuper corporations.\n\n\n* Comparison with smartphones -- There existed smartphones, but what the iPhone changed was that you could build on that. Didn't have to be a GPS expert to build a location based app. Similar place in blockchain computers right now, very early.\n* Weaknesses like being slow etc can be fixed at some point. Early PCs cost 5000 USD in today's dollars, couldn't do much. These things get fixed.\n* Strength is the provable trust guarantees. Equivalent in smartphones -- GPS, camera, cellular connectivity. Took people time to figure out how to use these, same for blockchains.\n* Ethereum is a general purpose computer. Bitcoin is a application specific computer.

Problem is called State machine regulation.\nKnown number of servers, all are authorize.\n\nDifference in blockchain: Anyone can participate.\n\n### How are blocks added to the chain?\n\n\nusers can sign transactions, send to miners who add to blockchain, leader is elected, leader adds to chain, other miners validate, miner gets paid.\n\nLeader decided on the order of transaction in the block.\n\nFor example: Who gets to sell first is decided by the miner, not good.\n\nNot solved: how to do this in a way that no single miner has this control on the order of the transactions in the blockchain.\n\n**Sybil attack**: Miners could try to get elected every time by pretending to be a thousand different miners, other miners would never get elected\n\nSolve by forcing miners to commit resources.\n\nBitcoin, you have to solve problems requiring hardware (**proof-of-work**). energy is wasted, is very slow.\n\n**Proof of stake**: force people to commit to funds instead of CPU.\n\n**Proof of space**: Commit to disk space instead of compute power, doesn't take much energy.\n\n## Layer 1.5 -- Blockchain computer\n\nWrite apps, post to the blockchain.\nPeople send transactions to blockchain computer, apps running on the computer reply.\nRunning apps on the blockchain means\n* all code is open-source and public. No secrets because every thing is based on trust.\n* public verifiability -- anyone can verify state transitions on the blockchain computer. IRL, you have to trust banks / social media platforms etc.\n\n\n## Running programs on a blockchain\n\n* Create an app\n* post code to the blockchain. Code is a transaction in the chain.\n* Someone sends transaction to the application, state changes in the application.\n\n* Want to touch the blockchain as little as possible for scalability.\n\n\n## Execution environment\n* Bitcoin -- Bitcoin script, limited instruction set (no loops for example)\n* Ethereum -- General programming environment, solidity, web3\n  * Storing things on the blockchain is expensive.\n  * You have to pay to write today, will probably have to pay to store in the future.\n  * Developers will need to spend most of the time in removing data, not writing to the chain.\n* Modern blockchains are using WebAssembly -- write your app in favorite env, compile to WebAssembly, run on the blockchain.\n\n\n## Decentralized Applications (dapps)\n* Languages: Solidity, Move\n* If you make a mistake, you can lock out millions of dollars. Mistakes are costly!\n\n## Layer 4 - user facing servers\n\n* Users talk to normal computers that talk to the blockchain.\n* MakerDAO -- took Fed policy, implemented in an algorithm\n* Compound -- Lending platform\n\n\n# Cryptographic primitives\n\nBlockchains are consumers of cryptography.\n\n## Digital signatures + aggregation\n\n* Physical signatures can't work in the digital world, because you can just copy the bits.\n* Solution: Make the signature depend on the thing that you're signing. signing key + algorithm -> signature which can later be verified.\n* Need your signing key to generate signatures.\n\n### Signatures on the blockchain\n\n* Txn authorization\n* Governance vots\n* Consensus protocol votes.\n\nNote: ALL miners verify the signatures.\n\n### Signature aggregation\n\nCompression mechanism: Compress N signatures into 1, verify using all public keys + txn ids.\n\nExample: blockchain called chia: takes a bunch of transactions, aggregates and stores the aggregate, less data on the blockchain.\n\n\n## Merkle commitments\n\nCryptographic commitment: Emulates an envelope.\n\nSealed bid auction: every participant **commits** to its bid. Once all bids are in, auctioneer can see who wins the auction.\n\nCommit(data) => (com, open)\nVerify (data, com, open) => \"accept\" or \"reject\"\n\nSealed bid in a digital environment:\n* You send `com` and `open` to the auction house.\n* Then the auctioneer can verify that you actually did commit `data` before.\n\n\n### Properties\n\nBinding: Cannot produce two valid openings.\nHiding: `com` cannot tell you the data.\n\n### Merkle tree\n\nSuccinct commitment / Merkle tree: commit to gigabytes of data in 32 bytes and open individual cells correctly\nWrite merkle commitment of 1000s of transactions in one block.\n\nApplications:\n* proof of payment by quick verification of commitments\n* keeping state of chain: Database of account balances off chain. off-chain: servers with balances, on-chain: short commitment of balances, don't need to write entire database on the blockchain.\n\n\n## Zero knowledge proof system\n\nAnything that can be proved can also be proved in zero knowledge.\n\n\nProver wants to prove: \"I have a signature on Txn, witness: signature\" in zero knowledge without telling the signature\nProver gives the proof to the verifier and verifier verifies the proof.\n\n\nSNARK // zkSNARK\n\nLibraris for zkSnark: circom, zinc\n\nSuccinct proofs: put in a rollup server, so that miners only have to verify succinct proofs of the transactions instead of verifying all txns.\n\nApplication 2: Private data on a public blockchain. Currently, all txns are public.\n\nWrite only *commitments* to the blockchain,\n\n\n## REMEMBER\n\n* don't put data on the blockchain, it's not a database.\n* Always ask: why not use a centralized system?\n* Blockchains are best when there is NO single party that you can trust.\n* very likely that we'll converge onto small number of architectures from the large number of blockchains.\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/ugIpMsTgtnDtnSyD5Hcoa.html","relUrl":"notes/ugIpMsTgtnDtnSyD5Hcoa.html"},{"doc":"Chess","title":"Chess","hpath":"chess","content":"","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/NRVQYjimC6Q-xUh3YyUTC.html","relUrl":"notes/NRVQYjimC6Q-xUh3YyUTC.html"},{"doc":"Rooks","title":"Rooks","hpath":"chess.rooks","content":"\n* If you want your rooks to be effective, put them on an open file.\n* Without open files, bishops or knights might easily outperform the rook, leaving it sitting passively behind its pawns.\n* A half-open file is often used to exert tremendous pressure against weak enemy pawns.\n* A file is very valuable because it's the road that the rook travels to infiltrate the enemy's position.\n* Rooks are very powerful on the 7th or 8th rank.\n* A rook on the 7th rank annoys the enemy king, but also targets all the enemy pawns that haven't moved yet.\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/swEWbNLqKn93ydlFNqgUy.html","relUrl":"notes/swEWbNLqKn93ydlFNqgUy.html"},{"doc":"Puzzles","title":"Puzzles","hpath":"chess.rooks.puzzles","content":"\nhttps://lichess.org/study/SEKflmJB\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/oD0kkeJ1sWKWpuhTExe1S.html","relUrl":"notes/oD0kkeJ1sWKWpuhTExe1S.html"},{"doc":"1","title":"1","hpath":"chess.rooks.puzzles.1","content":"https://lichess.org/study/SEKflmJB/4w1BbCet\n\n\nrooks are nicely doubled, but it's hard to infiltrate because of the knight on d4 and the queen on d3\n\n\nYou want to exchange the knights so that there is less pressure.\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/OQVLB0pXG9XNcxB6NCSdt.html","relUrl":"notes/OQVLB0pXG9XNcxB6NCSdt.html"},{"doc":"Kingside Attack","title":"Kingside Attack","hpath":"chess.kingside_attack","content":"\nhttps://lichess.org/study/DVIX3vFT\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/VUB1Q10sdIyTwvNpi22xL.html","relUrl":"notes/VUB1Q10sdIyTwvNpi22xL.html"},{"doc":"von Scheve - Teichmann, Berlin 1907","title":"von Scheve - Teichmann, Berlin 1907","hpath":"chess.kingside_attack.von_scheve_teichmann","content":"\nLichess: https://lichess.org/study/DVIX3vFT/dMmDL5SF\n\n\nOne bad move here are `9 h3`, it opens up the pawn for a sacrifice\nin which you take the pawn for a bishop, breaking open the king's space, you also can take another pawn later with Qg3+ followed by Qh3.\n\nAnother bad move was exchaning the knights on move 10.

They can also make humans\ndo the bare minimum (or even less).\n\nLet's do a couple of examples.\n\nI'll start with my alma mater (where else would I start with other than NIT Hamirpur,\nthat microcosm simulating the real world in so many ways). Getting into the college\ninvolves passing a mind-numbingly competitive exam and realistically only very\nhard working people are admitted into the college. However, the quality of the engineers (or researchers)\ngraduating from the college is very obviously sub-optimal. This isn't a controversial\nclaim at all, and the same can be said for thousands of colleges across India.\nHere's the most probable cause in my opinion. The examinations at NITH are essentially fake,\nwith students getting great grades for writing long paragraphs that don't even need\nto make sense into paper. What this means is that there is no real incentive to\nactually understand the course material. Even if a student is particularly\nhard-working, the thing they'll work hard on is rote learning which won't lead\nto any long term benefits. The college is incentivizing the wrong thing\nand that's why a majority of graduating engineers are sub-par.\n\nLet's do another example. A idealistic person gives a competitive exam and gets\na job in the Indian public sector, the coveted government job well-paid and stable.\nThe person has worked hard for the job and is prepared to work hard in the future as\nwell. However, they soon realize that growth in the public sector is not dependent on\nperformance or hard work or such trivial things, what really matters is who you know\nand who knows you. The way to get ahead is not to work hard (leading to personal\nand organizational growth), but to play politics, push others down and get head.\nEveryone else in the organization is doing it, you won't go anywhere if you don't.\nThe incentives in most government organizations are upside-down, which is why\nthey're inefficient and corrupt. There's a reason why the market cap of HDFC is\ntwice the market cap of SBI. It's because HDFC doesn't incentivize playing a zero-sum\ngame of politics and status, instead incentivizing performance.\n\nHumans are remarkably resourceful creatures. The amount of technology\nwe as a two limbed species have developed in our small lifetime is mind-blowing.\nHowever, growth is faster in some places and slower in others. Most of these\ndifferences in rate of growth can be attributed to different incentives. As individuals\nin control of organizations and institutions today (or in the future), we should\nbe very mindful of what incentives we're creating and whether they will actually lead\nto the outcome that we want. If you want something to grow, you need to give stakeholders\nthe incentive to help it grow.\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/fe9fd9ee-6834-4a9b-a316-a447eeff8aa0.html","relUrl":"notes/fe9fd9ee-6834-4a9b-a316-a447eeff8aa0.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/changelog.html","relUrl":"notes/changelog.html"}]
