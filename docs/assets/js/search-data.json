The HEAD of `production` is\nwhat the site was running at any moment. People made pull requests based off `master`, stuff got merged into `master`\nand _eventually_ got released.\n\nEach release required merging master into production. However, there may have been hotfixes to production in the meanwhile\nas well. So what we ended up doing to bring master and production into sync was:\n\n1. Merge `master` into `production`.\n2. Deploy the `production` branch.\n3. Merge `production` back into `master`.\n\nThe time between releases could be months! The commit difference between master and production\nwas often in the order of hundreds. This made releases painful and we had to be extra careful. If there\nwas a schema change involved, that made things even more complicated.\n\n## After\n\nThe change that we made is merging stuff into master as often as possible. And as soon as it's merged, release\nthe changes into production. This set up a decent pipeline where each release consisted of a small number of pull requests,\nmaking it much easier to release stuff.\n\nOver the last 3 months, we've done 33 releases (almost 3 deploys a week), which account for ~400 commits.\n\nThere have been a number of advantages to this approach. The deployer doesn't feel as concerned releasing 1 small pull\nrequest vs releasing 100 huge pull requests merged into master a few months ago. It also sets up a quick feedback loop\nfor the developer who gets to see their changes working in real life as soon as their pull request gets merged.\n\nGiven our engineering capacity, this new method of releasing stuff often has really helped in making ListenBrainz\na more active project.\n","url":"https://notes.param.codes/notes/27869ad9-d1bc-4585-b57c-8a8450f37c1b.html","relUrl":"notes/27869ad9-d1bc-4585-b57c-8a8450f37c1b.html"},{"doc":"Deploy to PyPI","title":"Deploy to PyPI","hpath":"engineering.deploy_to_pypi","content":"\n\nEach package needs a `setup.py` file which pip will use to install the package.\n\nInstall the dependencies needed.\n\n```\n$ pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine\n```\n\nFirst, create the files that need to be uploaded.\n\n```\n$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\nThis should create two files in the `dist` folder.\n\nCreate an account on https://pypi.org and a upload token.\nThen, upload the file using twine.
