<p>(SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU CARE ABOUT MARVEL MOVIES AND HAVE NOT SEEN THE NEW SPIDER-MAN MOVIE.)</p>
<p>The new Spider-Man movie was released this week.
It's a very ambitious project, combining nearly 20 years of Spider-Man history and uniting all three iterations of the character via multiverse shenanigans.
I won't discuss exact plot details, but as is characteristic of the MCU, they were really easily able to capture the great scope of the movie and still make it feel all deserved.
When I watch these amazing Marvel movies, I can't help but think of the amount of potential that has basically just been wasted away by Marvel's counterparts at DC/Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>Marvel was, a few decades ago, basically bankrupt. The comics weren't doing very well, no-one really cared about any characters other than X-Men and Spider-Man. Meanwhile, DC had two of the most well known superheroes in popular culture, Superman and Batman. They had amazing comics which are considered required reading. How do you waste away all this potential?</p>
<p>One of the major reasons why Marvel is doing well while DC isn't, seems to be just plain basic lack of vision. They just did not know what to do with anyone who isn't Batman. After the release of the first Avengers, they were basically relegated to playing catch-up. They wanted to do a team up movie to rival the scale of Avengers, but none of it felt deserved. Marvel started small, built up momentum, waited things out before making their biggest plays. Thanos was basically built up for half a decade before they made him the main antagonist of a movie. Contrast that with DC, where there was basically no build-up, they adapted one of Superman's classic stories, The Death of Superman, in his second movie.</p>
<p>Another thing that I think Marvel does right is that they trust their source material and audience. When the first Avengers came out, the idea of a multiverse spanning Spider-Man crossover with three different Spider-Men and villains from years ago was probably not even dreamt of by the craziest fans. These kind of shenanigans were relegated to crazy comic crossovers that were read by at most a thousand people who were the geekiest of geeks. However, Marvel hasn't been afraid of leaning into this kind of stuff for years now, especially since they found their footing after the Avengers was successful. There is merit to this approach, these crazy comic book storylines make for very good viewings on the large screen. They're popular within the comicbook fanbase for a reason. There is a large population among superhero fans who want these larger than life stories, and don't want to watch a pseudo-realistic adaptation of Batman, a guy who dresses like a Bat and whose biggest enemy is a clown, for the nth time.</p>
<p>However, you can't just throw normal audiences into this in your first movie, you have to be patient. The first Spider-Man movie was a simple Spider-Man tale fighting a normal Spider-Man villain. It hit the exact right beats for a new Spider-Man movie, didn't rehash anything and made you care about the new Spider-Man. Contrast this with Man of Steel, which made Superman grimdark, had him <em>kill</em> in the first movie. In the followup, they brought in Batman, Lex Luthor, Doomsday and adapted Death of Superman, which meant killing Superman in his second movie and going into Justice League with a dead Superman that will need to be revived somehow. Thing is, all this was so rushed that even me, who really cared about these characters, could not feel invested. I just did not care about Justice League. I watched it like 2 years after it was released just because I knew it wasn't going to do justice to my favorite characters. If core fans don't care about your stuff, you can't even remotely expect normal people to.</p>
<p>DC is still making the same mistakes, to be honest. The upcoming Flash movie is overly complicated already, it has two Batmen, wants to adapt Flashpoint but there is zero buildup to this. Why does anyone who's not a comicbook geek even care about the Flash? They don't.</p><span id="navId" data="avsCQQZuo7gjntKQ3gXpC"></span>
