<p>Kashmir's education (and most else) has been fucked up since 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of pupils fell by 175,000 last year, a precipitous decline for a system that serves some 2m children. (Only 19,000 dropped out in 2018.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An estimated 2,000 Kashmiris travel abroad to study every year, a figure that fell to zero in 2020</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Child psychiatrists say many pupils are struggling to cope with attending school at all, having lost social skills and the ability to concentrate. Parents, too, have suffered. The past two years have seen a surge in requests for help with aggressive children. “It was a dribble and now it is a stream,” says Nasir Geelani, a psychologist who conducted a small survey of locals in Srinagar last year. Some 62% expressed anxiety about their circumstances and 72% said they felt a lack of purpose in life.</p>
