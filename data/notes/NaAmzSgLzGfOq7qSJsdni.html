<p>An affordance is a relationship between the thing we're designing and the agent using it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A door handle affords people the ability to open a door</li>
<li>Whatsapp affords users the ability to talk with friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing to remember here is that affordances are not just properties of the thing, but a relationship between the thing and the agent using it.</p>
