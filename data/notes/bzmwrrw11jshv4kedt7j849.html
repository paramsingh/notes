<ul>
<li>I have been doing an average of 27km every week for the past 9 weeks.</li>
<li>VO2 Max is increasing, garmin says it's 52 now, I started with 48.</li>
<li>I know the absolute value is likely very inaccurate but the fact that it's increasing gives good signal.</li>
<li>Also hit my 1k PB after years! 4:25 min/km</li>
<li>Next up is 5k PB soon.</li>
