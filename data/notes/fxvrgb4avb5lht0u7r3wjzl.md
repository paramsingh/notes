Infrastructure:

- Storage
- Communication
- Computation

Would love to build abstractions that hide the implementation details.

Topics:

- Implementation

  - RPC - mask that we're communicating over an unreliable network
  - Threads - Structure concurrent operations
  - Concurrency control - Locks.

- Performance

  - Scalable speed-up

- Fault tolerance

  - Availability
  - Recoverability

- Consistency
  - Put(k, v)
  - Get(k) -> v
