<p>For background, there was a popular protest happening in Bihar called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Movement">Sampoorna Kranti movement</a>,
led by veteran Gandhian, Jayaprakash Narayan. Indira Gandhi did not support the movement and had claimed that the movement was
being funded by foreign donations and moneyed interests.</p>
<p>On being found guilty of using state machinery for electoral purposes in 1975, <a href="/notes/VIlW7aC9gjhCeho0t838Q">Indira Gandhi</a> declared a state of emergency.
Political opponents were detained and jailed. Elections were suspended, the press was censored. Sanjay Gandhi took hold of a number
of authoritarian policies, like forced sterilization.</p>
<p>Eventually, the emergency was lifted after 2 years, in 1977.</p>
<p>A general election followed where Congress lost by record numbers. Indira lost her seat of Rae Bareilly, while Sanjay
was defeated in Amethi.</p>
