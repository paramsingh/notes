<h1 id="oracle">Oracle<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#oracle"></a></h1>
<p>An oracle is a superintelligence that takes a question and answers it for you.</p>
<p>It's easier to make these safe on the outset, because you could make sure it has no access to the outside world. You could also make it so that the AI resets after each question.</p>
<p>However, it does have an issue where some person could use it to get a malicious plan and execute it themselves.</p>
