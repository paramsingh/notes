Purushottam Das Tandon was a freedom fighter who became the Congress' President in 1950.
Tandon had been put forward by Sardar Patel as the presidential candidate. Tandon is
said to have the image of a soft Hindu Nationalist leader. He had strong opinions against
religious conversion of people and opposed religious propagation. He also strongly advocated
for Hindustani, a mixture of Hindi and Urdu, being adopted as the national language of India.

Tandon had differences with Nehru who thought that his election meant that the party was giving
in to communal forces. Tandon eventually resigned from the post of President due to these
differences, with Nehru taking the post of President.
