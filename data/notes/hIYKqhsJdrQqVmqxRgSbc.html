<ul>
<li>An active bishop is one which has diagonals not cluttered by enemy pawns, own pawns or pieces.</li>
<li>A good bishop is useful and active, it's serving a purpose (for example, defending a pawn) and also active.</li>
<li>A bishop is called a tall pawn when it's not doing anything useful and is trapped behind its pawns.</li>
<li>Think before putting your pawns on the same squares as your bishop.</li>
