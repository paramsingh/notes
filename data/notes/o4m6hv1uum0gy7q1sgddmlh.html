<p>Woke up at 10:30. Bad dream.</p>
<p>The things I build are more popular on Twitter. It's a nice way
to motivate my lizard brain to actually ship things.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/T4ea2dCnXXW7SbPu0BnwF">Ideas</a>: I should consider finetuning GPT-3 or something on
good text-based adventure games to see if the quality of the
stories increases</p>
<p><a href="/notes/9bn8iwfv72uv75ionw8ftql">Todo</a>: I also need to figure out a plan of attack on
<a href="https://scrollprize.org">https://scrollprize.org</a> , my goal for this year is to make
an actual submission I'm proud of.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/9bn8iwfv72uv75ionw8ftql">Todo</a>: need to upgrade mastodon</p>
<p><a href="/notes/9bn8iwfv72uv75ionw8ftql">Todo</a>: need to look at upgrading dendron on this repo once</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon putting all the ai art i've generated in
one place: <a href="/notes/b1pzhr3d2mr8p0clk0ff1d2">AI Art (Dall-E 2 and Midjourney)</a>, looks very cool. Took
a bunch of time to debug some bug and resize the images so that
the page doesn't crap out.</p>
