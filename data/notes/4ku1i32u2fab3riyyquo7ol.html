<p>I think I have a good idea on my hands.</p>
<p>I was watching "The fable of the dragon tyrant" video and noticed that
it's not really huge animations. So I'm going to convert stories
from <a href="https://adventures.param.codes">https://adventures.param.codes</a> to video. The Dall-E images
can be frames and I could use elevenlabs for TTS. I'll
experiment and see how they turn out, but overall sounds like a fun
project.</p>
<p>I'm basically making art using AI, this is kind of incredible to be.</p>

<p>Thinking about it more, I could even make good content out of this.
