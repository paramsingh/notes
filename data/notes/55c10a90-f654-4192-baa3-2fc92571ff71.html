<p>The Tang dynasty came into power after a short living Sui dynasty re-united China into a single kingdom
after the divisions that followed the Han dynasty. They ruled for almost 3 years (~600 to 900 AD).</p>
<p>Wu Zetian was the de-facto ruler of the Tang dynasty for almost a 100 years.</p>
<p>The empire was challenged, because of ambivalence in military matters, by the Tibetan empire which
essentially took over Qinghai and Southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The Tang era is considered very good for arts and culture. Li Bai and Du Fu, two of the most famous
poets of China, lived during the Tang era.</p>
