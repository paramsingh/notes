<p>One of my tweets went viral yesterday. I didn't really like seeing reddit
people fighting in my replies. This was the kind of thing that made
me run away from reddit.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventures.param.codes">https://adventures.param.codes</a> now has images. The images are surprisingly
great. I only need to fix the story now for it to be quite good. GPT-3 forgets
how long the story has gone, so I need to keep reminding it.</p>
<p>Some choice comments for adventures from twitter:</p>
<ul>
<li>infinite zork but with images</li>
<li>bandersnatch but better</li>
<li>i play it while my uber rides are getting cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should put these on the website.</p>
<p>People like the idea. One person is making the same thing but for
romance movies like Before Sunrise etc. Quite cool.</p>
<p>I've been added to a group of anon/pseudo-anon twitter engineers.
Also quite cool, making friends on the internet seems like a nice idea.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/9bn8iwfv72uv75ionw8ftql">Todo</a>: TDM gave me the idea of prefetching the next 4 options async so
that things are faster. that's a great idea!</p>
<p>I need to dive a bit deep into this: <a href="https://github.com/educelab/volume-cartographer/discussions/10">https://github.com/educelab/volume-cartographer/discussions/10</a>
This seems like a software engineering task that I could actually do, and it lines up with my
own python expertise too.</p>
<p>Ok, I left a comment, probably going nowhere but let's see. Maybe I spend some time doing
research this week.</p>
