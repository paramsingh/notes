Hi! I'm Param! This is a place for my personal notes.

My website is https://param.codes, and I write more readable
stuff on my substack: https://newsletter.param.codes.

I've found that taking notes helps me remember things, and it's nice
to look back on information that you processed years ago. I jot down random things, there's no real structure, but some of these
notes could eventually become blog posts.

Some notes you might find interesting:

- [[history.laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance]]
- [[engineering.being_a_mentor]]
- [[history.china.dynasties]]
- [[history.india.indira_gandhi]]

I also keep notes on books I read [[here|books]].

This is built using [[Dendron|engineering.dendron]] and hosted using
[GitHub Pages](https://github.com/paramsingh/notes).
