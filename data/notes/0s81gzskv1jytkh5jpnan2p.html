<ul>
<li>i need to make sure that the app is usable for me personally before jumping into
marketing etc.</li>
<li>currently user retention is bad enough that the app doesn't even keep me retained.</li>
<li>i want to be proud of this project, so need to do better</li>
<li>ideas for myself
<ul>
<li>it's disappointing to see that you need to review a bazillion games, so probably
a limit there makes sense.</li>
<li>there are currently 4 buttons on the site for reviewing, it should only be one.</li>
<li>this will involve mixing in new games and games already reviewed, i can't remember off
the top of my head why i separated them, but right now it makes sense to me to only have the one button (review games for today).</li>
<li>i should probably put this stuff in the site asap so that even if the app is not there,
i can still get feedback from myself on how it works.</li>
