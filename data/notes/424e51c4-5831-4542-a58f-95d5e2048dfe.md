_The man who changed India's map._

Before independence (and partition), most of India's political leaders agreed
that India should be divided into states on the basis of language.

However, with partition, this was put on hold by Nehru, in fear of further
dividing the country on lines of language, after it had already been divided
on the basis of religion.

Potti Sriramulu was a Gandhian who began a fast-unto-death in protest of
this decision which meant that Andhra Pradesh would not be created for Telugu
speakers, from the province of Madras. The government of India ignored this fast, until
58 days later, Sriramulu died. Hell broke loose after that. Government offices
were vandalized, trains wrecked. Several protestors were killed in police firings.

The government had to give in to the ask of creating Andhra Pradesh from the Telugu
speaking districts of Madras. This gave strength to similar arguments of states
based on language to other parts of India like Punjab, Maharashtra etc.
