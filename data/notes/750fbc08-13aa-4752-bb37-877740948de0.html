<ul>
<li>Supported</li>
<li>Trustworthy
<ul>
<li>Do I trust this alert to notify me when a problem happens?</li>
<li>Will it stay silent if things are ok?</li>
<li>Will it give me enough info to diagnose problems?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actionable
<ul>
<li>At most one decision should be required ideally, the decision to whether take an action or not.</li>
<li>Alerts that are difficult to action become alerts that are ignored. If an alert is painful or annoying to action, you'll feel fatigued next time.</li>
<li>Should try to avoid stuff like "investigate" etc, make things more optional. Decision trees, interactive tooling etc is much better.</li>
<li>If it's unclear who should be taking action, the alert is not actionable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Triaged</li>
</ul>
