<p>Read this interesting HN comment today: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30033270">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30033270</a></p>
<p>From later on in the thread</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™m firm, firm in my belief that the people who have chosen of their own free will to work for FAANG have made moral compromises that disqualify them from my employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This belief is very incorrect. There are a lot of people at FAANG. There is no real way to know their motivation behind working at FAANG. For example, I know a few people who wanted to get out of India and the only real options that help you do that are FAANG companies, especially if you're a new grad who does not have a lot of experience.</p>
<p>In general though, making value judgements towards literally thousands of people is probably not a sane decision and you should consider what biases you might have in your own life.</p>
