<p>In the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, voters rank candidates in their constituencies.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote">Wikipedia</a>,
each elector marks their ballot for the most preferred candidate and
also marks back-up preferences. The vote goes to the voter's first preference if possible,
but if their first preference is eliminated, instead of being thrown away,
the vote is transferred to a back-up preference, with the vote being assigned
to the voter's second, third, or lower choice or being apportioned
fractionally to different candidates.</p>
<p>This system is used currently in Ireland. Eamon De Valera however passed an

moving to <a href="/notes/4bSxkcLXi6cRckuS8hoWx">FPTP</a>. There was a referendum
where STV won the vote 51% to 48%.</p>
