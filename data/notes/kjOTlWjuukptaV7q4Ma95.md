From later on in the thread

>Iâ€™m firm, firm in my belief that the people who have chosen of their own free will to work for FAANG have made moral compromises that disqualify them from my employment.

This belief is very incorrect. There are a lot of people at FAANG. There is no real way to know their motivation behind working at FAANG. For example, I know a few people who wanted to get out of India and the only real options that help you do that are FAANG companies, especially if you're a new grad who does not have a lot of experience.

In general though, making value judgements towards literally thousands of people is probably not a sane decision and you should consider what biases you might have in your own life.
