<p>If you want to be better than average, you have to go down a non-average path.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is non-risky, for example, in school, to be better than average you only need to get better grades. There is no downside to getting better grades.</p>
<p>In comparison, in career terms, you need to take bolder risks to get better results. You can work at FAANG for years, but risking things by starting a business is the only way to get better than FAANG results. And FAANG is very much average at this point.</p>
