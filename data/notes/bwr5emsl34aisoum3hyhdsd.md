Looks like Stripe's equity has been converted to actual shares.
They've withheld Irish taxes.

My net worth has more than doubled in one day even after the taxes.
Still considering what to do with it. I'll probably sell.

I have a bunch of money that I don't know what to do with. I feel
like I'm wasting my time working this job. With the stripe equity,
I made more money than I'll make in the next 3 years based on my
salary here. Ugh.

And I don't know what to do with this money.

Tired as fuck. Basically pulling 12 hours days these days with office
work, helping Vijaya and personal projects. Interesting thing is
that I feel zero fatigue when working on personal projects, but it
hits very obviously when working on work stuff that actually
pays me and sponsors the personal projects.

GPT-4 is kinda expensive. I need to figure out a way to integrate it
without breaking the bank. It seems to be much better at stories though.
I wasn't able to try it too much on local dev, because my local environment
seems to send two requests every time for some reason. Can't
reproduce the same bug in production.
