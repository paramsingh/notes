<p>2025 was a big year!</p>
<ul>
<li>I got promoted to L3.</li>
<li>A senior and a staff engineer left my team, so I played the role of team lead for 2 quarters until a new staff engineer was hired.</li>
<li>I got married! It was a huge effort, requiring months of planning, shopping and organization. It was the most fun party I've been to in my life.</li>
<li>I broke multiple running PRs: 5k in 24:30 and 10k in 53:30. Ran a total of 1150km which is 150 km below target.</li>
<li>I built RunAI, an AI running coach, which I've found personally useful, I need to work on making it an actual serious project.</li>
<li>Vijaya had some health issues. It was quite stressful but we pushed through.</li>
<li>I read a whole bunch of books, the most interesting being Grant by Ron Chernow.</li>
<li>Much much more that I'm likely forgetting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misses">Misses<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#misses"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>I did not make any progress on the side-projects. It is important that I start making some money there, because the growth I'm seeing at my job will not fit my ambitions.</li>
<li>While I did do a lot of above L3 work this year, I am still not getting an Exceeds Expectations rating this year. The rating has monetary consequences and was a goal at the beginning of the year that I missed.</li>
<li>I have gained weight in the last few months, and running has stagnated. It started because I got busy with the wedding but I need to get back on track, improve my diet and start strength training.</li>
<li>I am not taking enough care of my mother. Her health is declining and she is lonely, I need to be better.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#looking-forward"></a></h2>
<p>There are a few principles that I think I need to <em>live</em> in order to have a good 2026.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every second counts.</li>
<li>Consistency is key.</li>
<li>Focus.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm in my 30s now, this is the time to get strategic and focussed.</p>
