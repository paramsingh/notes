<p>I'll paraphrase this fable from the book "Superintelligence".</p>
<p>There's a group of sparrows. One sparrow comes up with the idea, "We should try to find an owl egg as an owl could help us be much more productive, find food faster, build nests faster etc".</p>
<p>Most everyone agrees and people start trying to find owl eggs for society. One sparrow says, "But we also need to be able to control the owl! We have no idea how to do that?!"</p>
<p>The enthusiastic sparrows reply, "Domesticating an owl is a hard problem, we aren't even sure we'll find an owl, we should first try to find it and then we'll think of how to keep it in control"</p>
<p>The cautious sparrow isn't convinced, and starts researching how to control owls anyways. It's hard because there is no owl yet. Meanwhile, there's lots of work going on to find an owl.</p>
<p>How the fable ends is not yet known.</p>
