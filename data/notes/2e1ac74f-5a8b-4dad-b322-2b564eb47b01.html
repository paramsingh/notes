<p>China's currency in the middle ages was silver, which meant that
it was hugely important for the West as a large demand for silver
helped the West's silver mines stay alive.</p>
<p>From <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">books.debt (Private)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 1540, a silver glut caused a collapse in prices across Europe;
the American mines would, at this point, simply have stopped functioning
and the entire American colonization process foundered, had it not been
for demand from China.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By the late 16th century, China was importing almost 50 tons of silver
a year, ~90% of its silver, and in the 17th centure, 116 tons, over 97%.</p>
