<p>Looks like Stripe's equity has been converted to actual shares.
They've withheld Irish taxes.</p>
<p>My net worth has more than doubled in one day even after the taxes.
Still considering what to do with it. I'll probably sell.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of money that I don't know what to do with. I feel
like I'm wasting my time working this job. With the stripe equity,
I made more money than I'll make in the next 3 years based on my
salary here. Ugh.</p>
<p>And I don't know what to do with this money.</p>
<p>Tired as fuck. Basically pulling 12 hours days these days with office
work, helping Vijaya and personal projects. Interesting thing is
that I feel zero fatigue when working on personal projects, but it
hits very obviously when working on work stuff that actually
pays me and sponsors the personal projects.</p>
<p>GPT-4 is kinda expensive. I need to figure out a way to integrate it
without breaking the bank. It seems to be much better at stories though.
I wasn't able to try it too much on local dev, because my local environment
seems to send two requests every time for some reason. Can't
reproduce the same bug in production.</p>
