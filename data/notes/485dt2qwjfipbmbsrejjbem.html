<ul>
<li>Now that we merged groups into transcribe, I'm looking to create a group of YC videos.</li>
<li>Once I have a group, I can create a script that merges the index and we can see how long it takes.</li>
<li>I figure it'll take too long to do this in Python. If that's the case, we'll have to put the vectors in a vector database.</li>
<li>Suyash has done some work on this, so I moved on to adding some limits to make sure people can't
break the service or my wallet.</li>
<li>Added limits so that it's not possible to submit long videos unless logged-in</li>
