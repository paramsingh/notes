SICP is getting complicated, I like it, currently implementing an interpreter for lisp in lisp, a metacircular evaluator.

I need to figure out what my next project is. Usually these things come to me randomly, so waiting for
lightning to strike sadly. I wonder if I can make it easier some way.

In the meanwhile, I'll try to get mistral finetuned on a reasonably interesting dataset,
let's see how it works.

It is amazing that the most code I've written in the past few weeks has been in lisp.
