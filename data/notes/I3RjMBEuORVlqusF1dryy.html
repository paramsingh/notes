<p>Now that GitHub copilot can solve leetcode problems reasonably well, leetcode interviews seem even more pointless.</p>
<p>You don't use that knowledge much in real life anyways, and now on the off-chance that you did need to solve that problem,
you have an AI solve it for you. What then is the point of asking people these problems in interviews?</p>
