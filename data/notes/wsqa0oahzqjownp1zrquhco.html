<p>Finished the Robert Oppenheimer biography today. What an interesting character.</p>
<p>I'm quite amazed by the ability of polymaths to be able to do so much over the course of a few years.
Also, concerned that in the end, it's really about consistency and that's what I find the hardest.</p>
<p>Consistency comes from environment. I need to mould my environment into something that makes me do
things I want to do.</p>
