<h1 id="what-is-a-blockchain">What is a blockchain?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#what-is-a-blockchain"></a></h1>
<p>4 layers</p>
<pre><code>3   - User interface (web3)
2   - Applications (solidity, move, motoko)
1.5 - Compute Layer -- Blockchain computer
1   - Consensus Layer
</code></pre>
<p>Most of the exciting action is in the application layer.</p>
<h2 id="layer-1----consensus-layer">Layer 1 -- Consensus layer<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#layer-1----consensus-layer"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Public data structure (ledger) that provides
<ul>
<li>Persistence -- once added, data can never be removed (51% attack caveat)</li>
<li>Consensus -- ALl honest participants have the same data (eventual consistency**)</li>
<li>Liveness -- All honest participants can add data</li>
<li>Open -- Anyone can be a participant (some blockchains are open, some are permissioned)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not a new problem: Google, Amazon etc run a large number of machines that need to see the same data. Problem is called State machine regulation.
Known number of servers, all are authorize.</p>
<p>Difference in blockchain: Anyone can participate.</p>
<h3 id="how-are-blocks-added-to-the-chain">How are blocks added to the chain?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-are-blocks-added-to-the-chain"></a></h3>
<p>users can sign transactions, send to miners who add to blockchain, leader is elected, leader adds to chain, other miners validate, miner gets paid.</p>
<p>Leader decided on the order of transaction in the block.</p>
<p>For example: Who gets to sell first is decided by the miner, not good.</p>
<p>Not solved: how to do this in a way that no single miner has this control on the order of the transactions in the blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil attack</strong>: Miners could try to get elected every time by pretending to be a thousand different miners, other miners would never get elected</p>
<p>Solve by forcing miners to commit resources.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, you have to solve problems requiring hardware (<strong>proof-of-work</strong>). energy is wasted, is very slow.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of stake</strong>: force people to commit to funds instead of CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of space</strong>: Commit to disk space instead of compute power, doesn't take much energy.</p>
<h2 id="layer-15----blockchain-computer">Layer 1.5 -- Blockchain computer<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#layer-15----blockchain-computer"></a></h2>
<p>Write apps, post to the blockchain.
People send transactions to blockchain computer, apps running on the computer reply.
Running apps on the blockchain means</p>
<ul>
<li>all code is open-source and public. No secrets because every thing is based on trust.</li>
<li>public verifiability -- anyone can verify state transitions on the blockchain computer. IRL, you have to trust banks / social media platforms etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="running-programs-on-a-blockchain">Running programs on a blockchain<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#running-programs-on-a-blockchain"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create an app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>post code to the blockchain. Code is a transaction in the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone sends transaction to the application, state changes in the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to touch the blockchain as little as possible for scalability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="execution-environment">Execution environment<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#execution-environment"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin -- Bitcoin script, limited instruction set (no loops for example)</li>
<li>Ethereum -- General programming environment, solidity, web3
<ul>
<li>Storing things on the blockchain is expensive.</li>
<li>You have to pay to write today, will probably have to pay to store in the future.</li>
<li>Developers will need to spend most of the time in removing data, not writing to the chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modern blockchains are using WebAssembly -- write your app in favorite env, compile to WebAssembly, run on the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="decentralized-applications-dapps">Decentralized Applications (dapps)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#decentralized-applications-dapps"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Languages: Solidity, Move</li>
<li>If you make a mistake, you can lock out millions of dollars. Mistakes are costly!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="layer-4---user-facing-servers">Layer 4 - user facing servers<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#layer-4---user-facing-servers"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Users talk to normal computers that talk to the blockchain.</li>
<li>MakerDAO -- took Fed policy, implemented in an algorithm</li>
<li>Compound -- Lending platform</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cryptographic-primitives">Cryptographic primitives<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cryptographic-primitives"></a></h1>
<p>Blockchains are consumers of cryptography.</p>
<h2 id="digital-signatures--aggregation">Digital signatures + aggregation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#digital-signatures--aggregation"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Physical signatures can't work in the digital world, because you can just copy the bits.</li>
<li>Solution: Make the signature depend on the thing that you're signing. signing key + algorithm -> signature which can later be verified.</li>
<li>Need your signing key to generate signatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="signatures-on-the-blockchain">Signatures on the blockchain<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#signatures-on-the-blockchain"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Txn authorization</li>
<li>Governance vots</li>
<li>Consensus protocol votes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: ALL miners verify the signatures.</p>
<h3 id="signature-aggregation">Signature aggregation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#signature-aggregation"></a></h3>
<p>Compression mechanism: Compress N signatures into 1, verify using all public keys + txn ids.</p>
<p>Example: blockchain called chia: takes a bunch of transactions, aggregates and stores the aggregate, less data on the blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="merkle-commitments">Merkle commitments<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#merkle-commitments"></a></h2>
<p>Cryptographic commitment: Emulates an envelope.</p>
<p>Sealed bid auction: every participant <strong>commits</strong> to its bid. Once all bids are in, auctioneer can see who wins the auction.</p>
<p>Commit(data) => (com, open)
Verify (data, com, open) => "accept" or "reject"</p>
<p>Sealed bid in a digital environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>You send <code>com</code> and <code>open</code> to the auction house.</li>
<li>Then the auctioneer can verify that you actually did commit <code>data</code> before.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="properties">Properties<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#properties"></a></h3>
<p>Binding: Cannot produce two valid openings.
Hiding: <code>com</code> cannot tell you the data.</p>
<h3 id="merkle-tree">Merkle tree<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#merkle-tree"></a></h3>
<p>Succinct commitment / Merkle tree: commit to gigabytes of data in 32 bytes and open individual cells correctly
Write merkle commitment of 1000s of transactions in one block.</p>
<p>Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>proof of payment by quick verification of commitments</li>
<li>keeping state of chain: Database of account balances off chain. off-chain: servers with balances, on-chain: short commitment of balances, don't need to write entire database on the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="zero-knowledge-proof-system">Zero knowledge proof system<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#zero-knowledge-proof-system"></a></h2>
<p>Anything that can be proved can also be proved in zero knowledge.</p>
<p>Prover wants to prove: "I have a signature on Txn, witness: signature" in zero knowledge without telling the signature
Prover gives the proof to the verifier and verifier verifies the proof.</p>
<p>SNARK // zkSNARK</p>
<p>Libraris for zkSnark: circom, zinc</p>
<p>Succinct proofs: put in a rollup server, so that miners only have to verify succinct proofs of the transactions instead of verifying all txns.</p>
<p>Application 2: Private data on a public blockchain. Currently, all txns are public.</p>
<p>Write only <em>commitments</em> to the blockchain,</p>
<h2 id="remember">REMEMBER<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#remember"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>don't put data on the blockchain, it's not a database.</li>
<li>Always ask: why not use a centralized system?</li>
<li>Blockchains are best when there is NO single party that you can trust.</li>
<li>very likely that we'll converge onto small number of architectures from the large number of blockchains.</li>
