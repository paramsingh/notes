# Problem

A student wrote six distinct positive integers on
the board, and pointed out that none of them had
a prime factor larger than 10. Prove that there are
two integers on the board that have a common prime
divisor. Could we make the same conclusion if in the
first sentence we replaced "six" by "five"?

# Solution

Only possible prime divisors are 2, 3, 5, 7.

There are six numbers, so at least two of them will share the same prime divisor based on the [[math.pigeonhole-principle]]

Same if there were five numbers.
