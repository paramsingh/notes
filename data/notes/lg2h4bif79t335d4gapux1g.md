Working on adventures again. I've written a cron job to
ask gpt-4 to write a new premise everyday. This should
solve my problem of cycling through old prompts or creating
new ones manually which was a pain in the ass.

GPT-4 basically wrote the entire script for me, so that
was pretty cool.

Next step: videos!
