[claude code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) is a game-changer.
it's much faster to get stuff done because of all the tools it has access to.


[[blunderfest.always-same-games-bug]] and [[blunderfest.onboarding-imported-game-no-blunders]] would have
taken me at least 4-5x longer without this tool.


quite expensive right now though
