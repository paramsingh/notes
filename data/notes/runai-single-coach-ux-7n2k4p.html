<h2 id="problem">Problem<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#problem"></a></h2>
<p>Current app has multiple chat threads (general chat, chat per run, etc.). This feels like customer support tickets, not a coaching relationship. Users don't build a relationship with their coach.</p>
<h2 id="vision">Vision<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vision"></a></h2>
<p>One ongoing conversation with Coach Vayu. Like texting your real running coach.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single thread</strong>: No "new chat" button. Just your coach.</li>
<li><strong>Coach remembers everything</strong>: Past conversations, your goals, your injury history, what worked/didn't</li>
<li><strong>Runs feed in automatically</strong>: Coach sees your runs and can comment proactively</li>
<li><strong>Proactive coaching</strong>: "Nice 5k this morning - saw you negative split the last mile!" or "You mentioned your knee was bothering you, how's it feeling after today's run?"</li>
<li><strong>Home screen = coach</strong>: Open app, you're talking to your coach</li>
</ul>

<li>How does coach memory work? Separate memory tool that writes to DB?</li>
<li>What gets remembered vs what's just conversation context?</li>
<li>How do runs feed into the conversation? As system messages? Tool results?</li>
<li>Single conversation thread in DB, or something else?</li>

<ul>
<li>What does home screen look like? Just a chat interface?</li>
<li>Where do runs live? Still a separate tab, or integrated into coach view?</li>
<li>How does coach initiate? Push notifications? Messages waiting when you open app?</li>
<li>What happens to existing multiple-chat UI? Migration path?</li>

<li>When does coach reach out? After every run? Daily summary? Only notable events?</li>
<li>How to avoid being annoying?</li>
<li>Does this require background processing / cron jobs?</li>

<li>How does this change the current chat/conversation architecture?</li>
<li>What's the minimal change to test this hypothesis?</li>
<li>Can we prototype with current infra or need new backend work?</li>

<p>Help me understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Current chat/conversation data model</li>
<li>How AI coach currently gets context about runs</li>
<li>Where conversation history is stored</li>
<li>Current home screen / navigation structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Then let's sketch out what minimal changes would let us test the single-coach model.</p>
