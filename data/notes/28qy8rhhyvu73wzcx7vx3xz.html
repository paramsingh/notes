<p>There's a ton of space in higher dimensional data sets.</p>
<p>The size of the data space grows exponentially with
increase in dimensions. This means that the size of the
dataset must also increase.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/bsu4r9viecgm2dqik484ljp">K Nearest Neighbours</a> is susceptible to this issue because it requires a dense data set for good results.</p>
