<ul>
<li>Muhammad became a solitary wanderer, until one day, when he was around forty, some contact with the supernatural happened.</li>
<li>An angel called to him to become the messenger of God.</li>
<li>Muhammad began communicating a succession of messages.</li>
<li>Those who submitted to Allah's will came to be known as Muslims and the religion was Islam, both words derived from the same linguistic root.</li>
<li>Gradually, as support for Muhammad grew, his relations with the leading families of Quraysh became worse. They saw him as attacking their way of life.</li>
<li>In 622 AD, Muhammad left Mecca for Madina, an oasis settlement around 200 miles north of Mecca. This is known as the hijra.</li>
<li>From Madina, Muhammad gathered power and went into an armed struggle with Quraysh.</li>
<li>By 629, leaders of Mecca surrendered the city to Muhammad.</li>
