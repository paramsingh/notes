<p><a href="https://funnel.fyi">Funnel.fyi</a> has been growing at a reasonable pace.</p>
<p>Some ideas that I think I'd like to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the job application cards and use them to source job postings, showing them to other users.</li>
<li>More analytics, and some way to monetize it.</li>
<li>Monetization would mean asking people who are heavier users to pay some money to keep using it.</li>
<li>I want to chat with other companies in this space to see if there's any way to partner with them.</li>
</ul>
