<p>Some notes from the videogen project I did for a few weeks in 2023:</p>
<p>Videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@paramsingh258/shorts">https://www.youtube.com/@paramsingh258/shorts</a></p>
<p>thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the videos were slop. the best image to video model i had available for actual use programatically was stable video diffusion and it only output ~4-5s for each image at very low resolutions.</li>
<li>eventually i gave up on image to video completely as the videos were too low res for the algorithm to like</li>
<li>shorts are better than full videos if you want algorithmic pull.</li>
<li>subtitles are very important. shorts with subtitles do much better than shorts without them.</li>
<li>the amount of views you need to make money off of youtube is kind of insane. as far as i understand,
youtube doesn't count views that come from the shorts feed or from the home page feed for monetization. videos need to be really really good to make it.</li>
<li>another thing i tried was a video with much more manual interference. i tried making a
rk narayan story in the style of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrqSF2OOz_M">paperman</a>.
sadly, while it turned out reasonably, it took me a lot of time and i didn't really enjoy the process
enough to put more time into it.</li>
<li>overall, my personal intuition is thinking about this as an artist is better than thinking about it
from a swe perspective. inevitably someone will use these models to make great art, it would be nice to be that person.</li>
