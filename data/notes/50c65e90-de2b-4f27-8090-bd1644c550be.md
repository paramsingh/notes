* Failed experiment
* Deployed ~a year ago, deprecated some time ago

### Did not get much use. Why?
* No feeling of exclusivity. Should have been invite-only imo.
* Should have onboarded each user one by one. Giving everyone time to feel welcome, and not just go away.
* Should have expressed the benefits much more explicitly.
  *  No tracking
  * Still get the benefit
* Usecases were out of whack.
* People who want to talk to their friends do it over whatsapp.
* People who want to post photos or write tweets for an audience would prefer to do it for a large audience.

## Still think that there is potential

I figure there is still value that can be provided by having small
silos allowing for Facebook / Twitter like activities, but without
the tracking and the bad stuff. Developing a community, however, takes
quite a lot of care and one mis-step can be enough to kill it.
