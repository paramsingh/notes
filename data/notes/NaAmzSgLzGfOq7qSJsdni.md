An affordance is a relationship between the thing we're designing and the agent using it.


For example:

* A door handle affords people the ability to open a door
* Whatsapp affords users the ability to talk with friends.

The important thing to remember here is that affordances are not just properties of the thing, but a relationship between the thing and the agent using it.
