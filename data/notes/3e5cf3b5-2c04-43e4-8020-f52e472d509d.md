Following the [[Han dynasty | history.china.han]] there was a ~50 year break between the traditional
dynasties of China, with China being effectively divided into three kingdoms fighting for supremacy. This is
known as the Three Kingdom Period (~220 AD to ~280 AD).

The three kingdoms were the states of Wei, Shu and Wu.

The three kingdom period was followed by the Jin dynasty.
