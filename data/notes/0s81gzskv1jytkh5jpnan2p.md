- i need to make sure that the app is usable for me personally before jumping into
marketing etc.
- currently user retention is bad enough that the app doesn't even keep me retained.
- i want to be proud of this project, so need to do better
- ideas for myself
    - it's disappointing to see that you need to review a bazillion games, so probably
    a limit there makes sense.
    - there are currently 4 buttons on the site for reviewing, it should only be one.
    - this will involve mixing in new games and games already reviewed, i can't remember off
    the top of my head why i separated them, but right now it makes sense to me to only have the one button (review games for today).
    - i should probably put this stuff in the site asap so that even if the app is not there,
    i can still get feedback from myself on how it works.
