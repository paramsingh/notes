<p>If <a href="/notes/moHj9Z1asnfE8SFkG14G3">Takeoff</a> takes a short time (days, hours), then it's very unlikely that we'll have multiple projects leading to superintelligence.</p>
<p>One of the projects will probably have completed it's takeoff before other projects can start.</p>
<p>Similar logic can be used to say that if takeoff is slow (years, decades), then there's a high probability there will be multiple projects going to takeoff.</p>
