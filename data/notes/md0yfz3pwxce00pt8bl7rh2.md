[[Originals]] mentions that people in the middle of the status ladder are the most conformist.

The people at the top are expected to be leaders, and go off the travelled road. The people at the bottom have little to lose.

Middle status people ahve the anxiety of someone having ambition but also having a lot to lose. Hence, conformism.
