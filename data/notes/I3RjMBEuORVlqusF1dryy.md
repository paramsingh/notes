Now that GitHub copilot can solve leetcode problems reasonably well, leetcode interviews seem even more pointless.

You don't use that knowledge much in real life anyways, and now on the off-chance that you did need to solve that problem,
you have an AI solve it for you. What then is the point of asking people these problems in interviews?
