<p>Pakistan tried to foment an insurrection in Kashmir, ideally leading either to a war or in international
arbitration of the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>On 5 August 1965 between 26,000 and 33,000 Pakistani soldiers crossed the Line of Control dressed as Kashmiri
locals headed for various areas within Kashmir. Indian forces, tipped off by the local populace,
crossed the cease fire line on 15 August. Radio Pakistan announced that a popular uprising had broken out
in the valley. In reality, the local population was mostly apathetic.</p>

<p>In order to relieve pressure, New Delhi ordered the army to open a new front. Indian troops crossed the
Punjab border, heading straight for Lahore.</p>
