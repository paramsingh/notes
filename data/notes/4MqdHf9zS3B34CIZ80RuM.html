<p>Kind of the same quote as in <a href="/notes/FnHK0L0VU1Er9BcQxTZZ0">Julius Nyeyere</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the right to vote, to choose between this party or that, is by itself
not true democracy. Democracy is more than a legal right that the
citizen exercises on a certain day of the year when he enters a tiny
polling booth to mark an anonymous X on a ballot form. It is a process
of constant thought and action on the part of the citizen. It is
self-educational. It calls for participation, information, the capacity
to make up one's own mind.</p>
