* If you want your rooks to be effective, put them on an open file.
* Without open files, bishops or knights might easily outperform the rook, leaving it sitting passively behind its pawns.
* A half-open file is often used to exert tremendous pressure against weak enemy pawns.
* A file is very valuable because it's the road that the rook travels to infiltrate the enemy's position.
* Rooks are very powerful on the 7th or 8th rank.
* A rook on the 7th rank annoys the enemy king, but also targets all the enemy pawns that haven't moved yet.
