less than the land the refugees had in Pakistan (with the difference being in the order

<p>Graded cut meant that for the first 10 acres of any claim, 25% was cut. Higher claims meant
higher cuts, going up to 95% for claims in excess of 500 acres. Pretty similar to income tax
these days, although I'd like to see 95% tax for the obscenely rich.</p>
