<p>First president of Tanzania, elected in 1962.</p>
<p>Quite interesting quote about Democracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two essentials for "representative" democrary are the freedom
of the individual and the regular opportunity for him to join with
his fellows in replacing, or reinstating, the governement of his
country by means of the ballet box and without recourse to
assassination. An organized opposition is not an essential element,
although a society which has no reoom and no time for the harmless
eccenteric can hardly be called "democratic"</p>
