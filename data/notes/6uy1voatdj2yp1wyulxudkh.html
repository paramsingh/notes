<ul>
<li>the first chapter is about the battleground and leads to two lines of thought</li>
<li>one interpretation is that the gita says that war is the <em>dharma</em> of the warriors. although war is evil, it is justified for a just cause.</li>
<li>the other interpretation is that krishna is asking arjuna to fight against his own lower self, to restore righteousness.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>i do not see that any good can come from killing our relations in battle. O Krishna, i have
no desire for victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we would become sinners by slaying these men, even though they are evil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. there has never been a time
when you and I and the kings gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time
when we will cease to exist.</p>
