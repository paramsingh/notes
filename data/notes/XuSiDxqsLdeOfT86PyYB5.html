<p>I've realized that it's much easier for me to be productive when I have a deadline.</p>
<p>The most common way this happens is that I procrastinate on some ticket until planning.
Then planning day comes and I need to make progress on those things.</p>
<p>The way to fix this is set artificial deadlines I guess?</p>
