If you want to be better than average, you have to go down a non-average path.

Sometimes this is non-risky, for example, in school, to be better than average you only need to get better grades. There is no downside to getting better grades.

In comparison, in career terms, you need to take bolder risks to get better results. You can work at FAANG for years, but risking things by starting a business is the only way to get better than FAANG results. And FAANG is very much average at this point.
