# Hi!

My name is Param Singh, I'm from India, I live in Dublin and work at Stripe.

This is a weekly newsletter where I document my explorations across tech, finance, history, and life in general.
Every week, I write about interesting things I worked on, things I read, movies I watched and so on. I have two
major goals for this newsletter:

1. Create interesting content that helps me explain my perspective on things and is valuable to readers.
2. Improve my writing skills.

Thanks for subscribing if you already have, and if you haven't, please do!
