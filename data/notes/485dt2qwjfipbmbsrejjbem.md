# What are you working on today?

- Now that we merged groups into transcribe, I'm looking to create a group of YC videos.
- Once I have a group, I can create a script that merges the index and we can see how long it takes.
- I figure it'll take too long to do this in Python. If that's the case, we'll have to put the vectors in a vector database.
- Suyash has done some work on this, so I moved on to adding some limits to make sure people can't
  break the service or my wallet.
- Added limits so that it's not possible to submit long videos unless logged-in
