<h1 id="problem">Problem<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#problem"></a></h1>
<p>A student wrote six distinct positive integers on
the board, and pointed out that none of them had
a prime factor larger than 10. Prove that there are
two integers on the board that have a common prime
divisor. Could we make the same conclusion if in the
first sentence we replaced "six" by "five"?</p>

<p>Only possible prime divisors are 2, 3, 5, 7.</p>
<p>There are six numbers, so at least two of them will share the same prime divisor based on the <a href="/notes/ht0jheu2dftmdx3umljgcar">Pigeonhole Principle</a></p>
<p>Same if there were five numbers.</p>
