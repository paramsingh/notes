<p>I've added a sprite that can now move around using the arrow keys. I now need to find a way to know what the map tiles are in code,
like water, grass, mountains etc, so that the character is limited. Then I need to give GPT-4 control.</p>

keep making small amounts of progress.</p>
<p>Also, I've run 30km in the last 5 days, so yay.</p>
