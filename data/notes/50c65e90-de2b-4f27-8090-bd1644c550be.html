<ul>
<li>No feeling of exclusivity. Should have been invite-only imo.</li>
<li>Should have onboarded each user one by one. Giving everyone time to feel welcome, and not just go away.</li>
<li>Should have expressed the benefits much more explicitly.
<ul>
<li>No tracking</li>
<li>Still get the benefit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usecases were out of whack.</li>
<li>People who want to talk to their friends do it over whatsapp.</li>
<li>People who want to post photos or write tweets for an audience would prefer to do it for a large audience.</li>

<p>I figure there is still value that can be provided by having small
silos allowing for Facebook / Twitter like activities, but without
the tracking and the bad stuff. Developing a community, however, takes
quite a lot of care and one mis-step can be enough to kill it.</p>
