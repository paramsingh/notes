i think when working on making the one "review your games" button,
i (CLAUDEEEE) added a bug that means it always starts with the same games no matter
what. need to fix.


spent a bunch of time with claude debugging and it seemed like a weird bug with the
specific game, deleted the game, claude wrote a nice delete game script and summary:
