<p>Woke up late today 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Going to get my learner's license before I start work.
I need to finish $CURRENT_PROJECT soon and get started
on $NEXT_PROJECT.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/bxjlded8i18qsasyy6wblbw">@csparker247</a> replied to my GitHub comment. I need to look
into the current python bindings. I think this is going to
be my project for the week.</p>
<p>I'm feeling a little tired. I think sitting for 10-12 hours
is not a good idea. Going to go for a long run.</p>
<p>After that look at parsing junit xmls and then python
bindings.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/9bn8iwfv72uv75ionw8ftql">Todo</a>: use gpt-4 for adventures.</p>
<p>looking at the python bindings for volume-cartographer thing.
i think next steps should be for me to look at the
python bindings and see what i can improve. this might not be
the right project for me because i think it might involve more
C++ than python, which isn't really what i want to do.</p>
<p>i added some pre-fetching to the adventures site. matt said it's
a bit too fast now, which is good feedback imo :D</p>
<p>i'll add some streaming code, I think. but first i need to make the
text static.</p>
<p>also wrote some tests to help vijaya out.</p>
