<p>There is a lot of over-engineering in the world. I'm working on something
that requires me to install a nix package inside a dockerfile. nix apparently
like to run tests before installing a python package. the amount of productivity
loss because of one engineer's stupid decision is probably in tens of thousands
of hours. I wish I could just do my deep learning course instead of having
to deal with this shit.</p>
<p>Pomodoros are actually kinda good, it forces me to break the work into
smaller parts and try to finish in 25 minutes, which makes me a bit more
thoughtful on how to go about this.</p>
