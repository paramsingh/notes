<p>I used to read a lot of books when I was in high school.
There were few distractions then, I had no phone and not much access to the Internet.</p>
<p>My habit of reading broke at some point after I went to college. One of the major reasons
was the fact that now I had a phone and unlimited access to the Internet. Instead of reading
books, a lot of my time was spent scrolling though Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and so on. I still used
to read a few books every year, but it was much rarer now that a few years earlier.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get back into the groove of regular reading now for the past few months. I've found a few
things that have been helpful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading what I like:</strong> This seems simple, but it's quite easy to forget. I've wasted a lot of time trying to
make it through books that I did not like. Usually, this happens with books I think I <em>should</em> like, but somehow don't.
Reading books that don't capture my attention makes reading a chore and hard to do consistently. I've started taking breaks
from books that I don't seem to be enjoying, with the hope that I'll come back to it eventually (but if that doesn't happen, it's okay too!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding distractions:</strong> It's very easy to get distracted and spend time on Twitter or Instagram instead of reading actual good books.
This is especially an issue for me before bedtime at night when I actually should be reading a book before I fall asleep. To avoid these distractions,
I've started keep my phone in the living room. This means I only have books to keep me entertained before bedtime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these are small tricks, but they are effective. In the last two months, I've read 6 books, which I'm happy with. It feels like I'm cultivating the habit, and hopefully I can continue doing so.</p>
<p>Read what you like.</p>
<p>Avoid distractions.</p>
