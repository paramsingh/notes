<p>I don't remember where I read this, but the story goes as follows:</p>
<p>A professor divided his photography class into two groups and gave each group an objective.</p>
<p>Group 1 had to click as many photos in the semester as possible. The more photos a person clicked, the better their grade.</p>
<p>Group 2 had to click only one photo, but they'd be graded on how good the photo was, (on it's quality).</p>
<p>By the end of the semester, Group 1 not only had more photos, but also better photos than Group 2.
This was because Group 1 took more photos, and were able to learn and evolve their style, eventually leading to better photos.
On the other hand, Group 2 spent a lot of time theorizing, but never really improved.</p>
<p>The point of the story is that quality generally follows quantity. If you're not doing enough work, you won't do quality work.
This is a major reason why <a href="/notes/asRcNc9kVyOqJMVCBx8Ty">Consistency Is Key</a> and habits matter.</p>
