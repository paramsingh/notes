I don't remember where I read this, but the story goes as follows:

A professor divided his photography class into two groups and gave each group an objective.

Group 1 had to click as many photos in the semester as possible. The more photos a person clicked, the better their grade.

Group 2 had to click only one photo, but they'd be graded on how good the photo was, (on it's quality).

By the end of the semester, Group 1 not only had more photos, but also better photos than Group 2.
This was because Group 1 took more photos, and were able to learn and evolve their style, eventually leading to better photos.
On the other hand, Group 2 spent a lot of time theorizing, but never really improved.

The point of the story is that quality generally follows quantity. If you're not doing enough work, you won't do quality work.
This is a major reason why [[work.consistency-is-key]] and habits matter.
