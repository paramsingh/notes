<p>Some points for a blog post I want to write about notetaking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Books are fun when you're reading them, but it's hard to remember what they said.</li>
<li>Take notes to help you internalize things, and retain them longer</li>
<li>Also helpful when you want to write about something, but it's not really original content you'd put on a blog</li>
<li>Keeping it public helps you stay motivated to keep doing it.</li>
<li>I use <a href="/notes/ba8c1187-f136-4f4e-95a4-3dab646b2c71">Dendron</a></li>
<li>Also use <a href="/notes/ba8c1187-f136-4f4e-95a4-3dab646b2c71">Dendron</a> at work, to keep notes about projects, TODO lists, ideas, meeting notes, design docs and such</li>
<li>A lot of my notes are trivia that is interesting but I know I'll forget if I don't jot down.</li>
<li>The idea is to not just consume mindlessly, but also produce.</li>
<li>Once you produce something, you really know it.</li>
<li>Notes can also be quite a good unit of knowledge to be gained. Instead of thinking I'll read these many pages today, think I'll take these many valid notes today.</li>
</ul>
