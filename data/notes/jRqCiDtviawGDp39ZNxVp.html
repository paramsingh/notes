<p>A genie would take a command and then execute it.</p>
<p>The thing of concern here is misinterpretation, ideally the genie would not do some perversion of intentions, and actually solve what the asker intended it to do.</p>
<p>The fairytales about genies have many examples of genies taking a wish/command, and fulfilling it in a way that was not expected at all.</p>
