<p>One thing I've figured out is that consistency is really the only key thing to moving towards success.</p>
<p>If you consistently work on something for a long time, it's much more probable that the thing will be a success.</p>
<p>An example to think about is this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29998108">HN comment</a> about the guy spending a few hours every weekday on the same project.</p>
