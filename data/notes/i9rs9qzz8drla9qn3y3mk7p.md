talk about each of these in short, one sentence each should be fine, maybe an example.

general notes

- the 20 mile march is relevant. one example in personal life is running.
- strava has a "fitness score" feature that goes up as you consistently run. it simulates the body's endurance as it gets more accustomed to effort
- personal graph is clear loser

- there's effort there but i'm still at 36 after years, it would obviously be much better if i was more consistent even if i ran less.
- this is what fanatic discipline allows

- empirical creativity; being creative is important but it's also important to look at empirical data before making decisions. an example given is that of a group of mountain climbers trying to climb mt everest and deciding to stop their campaign in the face of potential harsh weather. they looked at the data and made their decision, which saved their lives.

- productive paranoia: bill gates was consumed by what could kill microsoft. even when microsoft was doing extremely well, he was concerned about how the internet would change things, this helped microsoft change focus onto internet explorer at the right time.
- fire bullets before cannonballs: one chapter talks about the importance of first making small bets before

- level 5 ambition: generally the leaders of these companies were not motivated by money or fame, more about a different purpose.
