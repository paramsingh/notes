Stories to make good reels out of:

- Lotus eaters

Things to improve:

- The LLM is auto-regressive. So I guess, I should ask it to generate a script first and then images out of the script.
- I need to add text to the video.
- Need to drastically improve the voiceover
- Instead of animating via stable video diffusion, maybe I should just pan the images

Also I need to consider making larger videos at some point.

- [] Script generation first
