<p>I have a bad habit of procrastinating at work.</p>
<p>One way to fix this might be to <a href="/notes/XuSiDxqsLdeOfT86PyYB5">set artificial deadlines</a>, because it's much easier for me to be productive when I have a deadline.</p>
<p>I should also <a href="/notes/ZgG15Onaw1BVis0B5nol1">remember</a> where I came from, and how this work is what I wanted to do (and still want to do), and not waste days.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius's quote to <a href="/notes/rjxB1prwNmGhXJ4QMXlef">get out of bed</a> applies here too.</p>
