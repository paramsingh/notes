<p>Working on adventures again. I've written a cron job to
ask gpt-4 to write a new premise everyday. This should
solve my problem of cycling through old prompts or creating
new ones manually which was a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>GPT-4 basically wrote the entire script for me, so that
was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Next step: videos!</p>
