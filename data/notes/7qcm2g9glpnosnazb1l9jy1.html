<p>over the past 3 runs where i've started to only run between 130-140bpm,
my pace has consistently been increasing by a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>first day: 8:40 min/km</li>
<li>second day: 8:00 min/km</li>
<li>third day: 7:40 min/km</li>
</ul>
<p>i think my body was just not used to staying in zone 2, all my easy
runs were in zone 3 as well.</p>
