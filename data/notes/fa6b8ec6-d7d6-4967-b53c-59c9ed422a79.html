<p>Came across this when Vijaya was interviewing with Intercom.</p>
<p>Intercom asks you to write code for a project called "minicom".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intercom/minicom-public">https://github.com/intercom/minicom-public</a></p>
<p>Quite interesting, and I think possibly a better alternative to "Bug Squash" interviews
that Stripe does, although I guess bug squash gives more signal for debugging that someone
writing their own code. This is more a heavyweight integration interview.</p>
