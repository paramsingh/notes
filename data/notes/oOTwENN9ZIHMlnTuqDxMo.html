<ul>
<li>If you want your rooks to be effective, put them on an open file.</li>
<li>Without open files, bishops or knights might easily outperform the rook, leaving it sitting passively behind its pawns.</li>
<li>A half-open file is often used to exert tremendous pressure against weak enemy pawns.</li>
<li>A file is very valuable because it's the road that the rook travels to infiltrate the enemy's position.</li>
<li>Rooks are very powerful on the 7th or 8th rank.</li>
<li>A rook on the 7th rank annoys the enemy king, but also targets all the enemy pawns that haven't moved yet.</li>
</ul>
