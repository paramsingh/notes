<p>Woke up at 7 AM today for a 7:30 meeting. This actually feels quite good.
There's no running around to the next meeting, and I have time to actually
think before getting to work. Will see if I can make this a
regular thing.</p>
<p>I finished <a href="/notes/hcdzcgflufb3w4km172lneb">Masters of Doom</a> yesterday. One big thing that stuck
with me from the book: Carmack was focussed on the work while Romero
became more and more distracted. Carmack had more success by the end.
Another thing that you learn: Romero tried to hire a lot more and ship
but it doesn't work that way. Carmack had a quote that said something
like "There is an ideal number of people on a project. If there are more
than that, productivity decreases. For id, the number is small". This
is quite relevant to today's layoffs and such.</p>
<p>Next book I'm reading is <a href="/notes/vf4rhd6s85t2c8l27u9ru5i">The Making of Prince of Persia</a>.</p>
<p>AI is coming for our jobs. I think a lot of people who churn code out
without much sense of what problem the business actually solves are going
to have a hard time. On the other hand, it's a great time to be a
solo dev! You have interns and pair programmers available on demand!</p>
<p>This seems like something I should read and know about: <a href="https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect">https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect</a></p>

<p>Noting down an idea, need to flesh out: if text is the universal interface,
writing as much as possible is a path to immortality. You're basically
changing the data in your brain into a format that a computer can read
and understand. (<a href="https://twitter.com/iliekcomputers/status/1639163648966004737">https://twitter.com/iliekcomputers/status/1639163648966004737</a>)</p>
<p>Exploring this more, what if I fine-tuned GPT-4 on everything I'd ever written
and then chatted with it. How would that work? Would it be good or bad?</p>

<p>Trying to solve this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/overview">Patent matching</a> kaggle problem using things I learned
from <a href="/notes/o39bxb71h0kuvqx0tvdxkpz">Lesson 4</a>, but struggling.</p>
<p>I need to spend a lot more time actually coding things before I can say with some
confidence that I know a little deep learning.</p>
