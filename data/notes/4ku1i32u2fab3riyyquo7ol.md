I think I have a good idea on my hands.

I was watching "The fable of the dragon tyrant" video and noticed that
it's not really huge animations. So I'm going to convert stories
from https://adventures.param.codes to video. The Dall-E images
can be frames and I could use elevenlabs for TTS. I'll
experiment and see how they turn out, but overall sounds like a fun
project.

I'm basically making art using AI, this is kind of incredible to be.

Thinking about it more, I could even make good content out of this.
zines like julia evans and suyash.
