* College was complete shit, but made you realize that the adults don't exist
* It's all you.

When I was a kid, I just went to school and mostly did what I was expected to do. My own agency in my actions
was low, probably lower than average. I read what was prescribed in the books, wrote what they wanted me to write
in the tests and life was pretty good. My school was pretty serious about academics though, and it didn't leave
too much time for me to even think about the road not taken. There was pressure (both self-inflicted and external)
to study more and more hours chasing the diminishing returns of the extra 0.1% of marks in the annual exams.

This isn't really uncommon, I assume this is the story of hundreds of millions of kids every generation.
