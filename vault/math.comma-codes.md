Comma codes are codes where each symbol is a string of 1s followed by a 0, except for the last symbol which is all 1s


$$
s_1 = 0; s_2 = 10; s_3 = 110; s_4 = 1110; s_5=1111
$$

[[Kraft| math.kraft-inequality]] sum:

$$
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = 1
$$

The Kraft sum being 1 means that there's no capacity for shortening any symbol more.
