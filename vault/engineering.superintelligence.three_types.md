The three types of superintelligence are:

1. speed superintelligence: same level as human intellect but orders of magnitude faster.
2. collective superintelligence: a group which has a collective intelligence much higher than anything human.
3. quality superintelligence: vague, but in general more intelligent, example comparing humans to apes, humans intelligence is quality improvement
