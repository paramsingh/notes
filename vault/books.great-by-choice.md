## the 20 mile march

- hit specific performance markers consistently over a long period of time
- delivering high performance in bad times and show restraing in good times
- clear performance markers
- self imposed constraints
- achieved with high consistency
- largely within control to achieve
- consistency is good, builds confidence
- discipline built reduces risk


## fire bullets, not cannonballs

- bullet is low cost low risk experiment
- based on bullets, concentrate resources and fire cannonballs
- more bullets, less cannonballs
- calibrated cannonballs - cannonballs that you have empirical evidence of success for based on bullets
- don't need to be more innovative, just a threshold of innovation is fine for success
- be an empiricist
- need a combination of creativity and discipline
