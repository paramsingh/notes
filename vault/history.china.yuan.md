The Yuan dynasty followed [[the Song dynasty | history.china.song]]. It was established by Kublai
Khan, a Mongol and a descendant of Genghis Khan.

Marco Polo was a famous writer who spent a lot of time in China under Kublai Khan.

Kublai Khan tried to invade Japan twice, both times unsuccessful.

By the time of his death, Kublai Khan was crippled with gout, and quite obese.

After Kublai Khan, there were no notable successors and the dynasty declined until it was taken
over by the [[Ming | history.china.ming]].
