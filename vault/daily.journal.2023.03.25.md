Woke up at 11 AM today. The waking up at 7 yesterday
kinda screwed things up, I guess.

I did get this week's newsletter done last night.
I used ChatGPT to help me with ideas, and then give
me feedback on the text. It was actually nice
feedback.

Talked with Akhilesh about AI stuff last night. He wants to start
a construction or export business because that stuff is
not going to be disrupted as easily as tech. But I'm not
really interested I feel. I got into tech because I thought
it was cool, not for the money. I see the future as being
more of a solo artist using AI to build even bigger things.

New washing machine being installed today. Why do all these machines
have thousands of options that no one ever uses?

Could all these paragraphs in this journal be tweets? What's stopping
me from just tweeting everything I think of? i guess i'll start just
tweeting things that can be extracted into the 280 character format.

using chatgpt to learn how to run a fastai regression model. it didn't
actually give me a good solution. maybe these things aren't as far
ahead as twitter would lead you to believe. let me try bing.
bing also gives me a `text_classifier_learner`. maybe i'm the one who's wrong?

ok, nvm. i'm going to start using dall-e to add images to text-adventures
and see where it goes. it won't be text-adventures but it doesn't really matter.
tried to use bing to get dall-e image. the boilerplate component is correct!
it was using fetch instead of the openai client. when i asked it to use the client,
it basically broke. gave me completions first, and then said the client doesn't
have support for the dall-e api, when it does actually. when i told it to
search for it explicitly, it did work though. this is actually a bit negative
for my productivity becasue i get nerd-sniped into making it do the correct thing
instead of just fixing what i want to do and going from there.

I just finished adding images to each text on https://adventures.param.codes.
The Dall-E prompts come from ChatGPT. This is quite amazing. The images really
add to the experience I think.

Thinking more about this, what stops me from creating entire books of short stories
out of this? Or hell, even movies or shows?
