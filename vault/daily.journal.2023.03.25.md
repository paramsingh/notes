Woke up at 11 AM today. The waking up at 7 yesterday
kinda screwed things up, I guess.

I did get this week's newsletter done last night.
I used ChatGPT to help me with ideas, and then give
me feedback on the text. It was actually nice
feedback.

Talked with Akhilesh about AI stuff. He wants to start
a construction or export business because that stuff is
not going to be disrupted as easily as tech. But I'm not
really interested I feel. I got into tech because I thought
it was cool, not for the money. I see the future as being
more of a solo artist using AI to build even bigger things.
