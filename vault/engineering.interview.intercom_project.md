Came across this when Vijaya was interviewing with Intercom.

Intercom asks you to write code for a project called "minicom".

https://github.com/intercom/minicom-public

Quite interesting, and I think possibly a better alternative to "Bug Squash" interviews
that Stripe does, although I guess bug squash gives more signal for debugging that someone
writing their own code. This is more a heavyweight integration interview.
