There is a lot of over-engineering in the world. I'm working on something
that requires me to install a nix package inside a dockerfile. nix apparently
like to run tests before installing a python package. the amount of productivity
loss because of one engineer's stupid decision is probably in tens of thousands
of hours. I wish I could just do my deep learning course instead of having
to deal with this shit.
