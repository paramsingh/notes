There is a lot of over-engineering in the world. I'm working on something
that requires me to install a nix package inside a dockerfile. nix apparently
like to run tests before installing a python package. the amount of productivity
loss because of one engineer's stupid decision is probably in tens of thousands
of hours. I wish I could just do my deep learning course instead of having
to deal with this shit.

Pomodoros are actually kinda good, it forces me to break the work into
smaller parts and try to finish in 25 minutes, which makes me a bit more
thoughtful on how to go about this.
