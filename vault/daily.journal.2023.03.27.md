One of my tweets went viral yesterday. I didn't really like seeing reddit
people fighting in my replies. This was the kind of thing that made
me run away from reddit.

https://adventures.param.codes now has images. The images are surprisingly
great. I only need to fix the story now for it to be quite good. GPT-3 forgets
how long the story has gone, so I need to keep reminding it.

Some choice comments for adventures from twitter:
* infinite zork but with images
* bandersnatch but better
* i play it while my uber rides are getting cancelled.

I should put these on the website.
