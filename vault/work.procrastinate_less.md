I have a bad habit of procrastinating at work.

One way to fix this might be to [[set artificial deadlines | work.its-easy-to-be-productive-with-a-deadline]], because it's much easier for me to be productive when I have a deadline.

I should also [[remember | work.should-remember-roots]] where I came from, and how this work is what I wanted to do (and still want to do), and not waste days.


Marcus Aurelius's quote to [[get out of bed |work.marcus-aurelius-get-out-of-bed]] applies here too.
