One bad move here are `9 h3`, it opens up the pawn for a sacrifice
in which you take the pawn for a bishop, breaking open the king's space, you also can take another pawn later with Qg3+ followed by Qh3.

Another bad move was exchaning the knights on move 10. That weakens the
kingside even more, basically  removing your knight from the defence and
black still has a piece there.
