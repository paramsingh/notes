[Funnel.fyi](https://funnel.fyi) has been growing at a reasonable pace.

Some ideas that I think I'd like to do:

* Take the job application cards and use them to source job postings, showing them to other users.
* More analytics, and some way to monetize it.
* Monetization would mean asking people who are heavier users to pay some money to keep using it.
* I want to chat with other companies in this space to see if there's any way to partner with them.
