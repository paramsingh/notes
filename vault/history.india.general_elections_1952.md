First instance of general elections following Universal Adult Suffrage (people aged 21 years or more)
in Independent India. 176 million Indians were voting for the first time, 85% of whom could not read or write.

Important political parties were:

* Socialist Party -- Jayaprakash Narayan, part of the Quit India Movement
* Jana Sangh -- predecessors to the BJP
* Communist Party of India -- strong in Telangana after the revolution there.
* Indian national congress -- eventual winner

Nehru did a huge tour of the country where he covered it end to end in 9 weeks, addressing millions of people
in his speeches.

The voter turnout was about 60%. Congress eventually won 364 seats out of 489 in Parliament. Nehru's popularity
was on display as Ambedkar lost in Bombay to an obscure politician called
[Kajrolkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narayan_Sadoba_Kajrolkar).
