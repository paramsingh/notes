For the number guessing problem, suppose we say that
the numbers being given to us are uniformly sampled
from the set.

Now if there are two candidate sets, then the probability
that the numbers have been sampled from the larger set if much lower in comparison to the smaller set

$$
P = (\frac{1}{n})^k
$$

where $$n$$ is the size of the set and $$k$$ is the number of numbers we've received.

This means that if we have two competing sets, the smaller one is more likely.
