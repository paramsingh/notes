Since the land in Punjab being
[[redistributed | history.india.land_redistribution_after_partition]] to the
[[refugees | history.india.refugee_crisis_after_parition]] was
less than the land the refugees had in Pakistan (with the difference being in the order
of millions of acres), a graded cut was implemented.

Graded cut meant that for the first 10 acres of any claim, 25% was cut. Higher claims meant
higher cuts, going up to 95% for claims in excess of 500 acres. Pretty similar to income tax
these days, although I'd like to see 95% tax for the obscenely rich.

Some lady named Vidyawati had a claim of 11,500 acres and was only allotted 835.
