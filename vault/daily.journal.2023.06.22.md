I've added a sprite that can now move around using the arrow keys. I now need to find a way to know what the map tiles are in code,
like water, grass, mountains etc, so that the character is limited. Then I need to give GPT-4 control.

Now that I'm making progress again, I feel less self-hatred and am quite excited to get this going again. Let's see if I can
keep making small amounts of progress.

Also, I've run 30km in the last 5 days, so yay.
