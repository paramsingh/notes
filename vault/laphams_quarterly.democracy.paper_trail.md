From an article written in 1835:

> Nothing but a newspaper can drop a thought in thousands of minds at the same time.

Wonder what the author would have thought of social media. :)

> Newspapers then become more necessary as men become more equal and
> individualism more to be feared.


> Hardly any democratic association can do without newspapers.

> Newspapers make associations and associations make newspapers.
