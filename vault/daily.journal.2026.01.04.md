- wonder if claude code for running actually makes sense?
- i guess redesigning and smaller improvements are higher priority
- how to prototype a better agent:
  - websockets for streaming messages
  - agents sdk and mcp for tools
- what 1% improvement do I need to make today
  - making the runs page better looking is the easiest one i guess
