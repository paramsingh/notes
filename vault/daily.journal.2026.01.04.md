- wonder if claude code for running actually makes sense?
- i guess redesigning and smaller improvements are higher priority
- how to prototype a better agent:
  - websockets for streaming messages
  - agents sdk and mcp for tools
- what 1% improvement do I need to make today
  - making the runs page better looking is the easiest one i guess


- in today's shameful display of low agency, i realized that i could submit my driving license new photos to Google for the play store thing. should have done it yday
- used codex for a large change today, gpt-5.2-codex is quite good, except it doesn't talk much and is less proactive.
- used skills and claude code plugins for the first time for some typography improvements.
