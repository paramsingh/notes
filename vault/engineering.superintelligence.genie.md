A genie would take a command and then execute it.

The thing of concern here is misinterpretation, ideally the genie would not do some perversion of intentions, and actually solve what the asker intended it to do.

The fairytales about genies have many examples of genies taking a wish/command, and fulfilling it in a way that was not expected at all.
