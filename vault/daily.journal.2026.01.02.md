It's not easy to hit claude code rate limits for me on working days.

## Why agency is an issue

Today I learned that it's possible to have a personal account on Google Play without creating a company. Mentally I had considered myself blocked on this because I didn't read the details well enough and just defaulted to not pushing.

I need to be faster, this is a daily exercise, this needs to get ingrained inside me.

## RunAI improvements

I've been using Claude to brainstorm a "vision" for RunAI, something that it should aspire to be, more than just another fitness app. There are some good ideas but I need to think more about it. In the meanwhile, the focus is on shipping basics like Auth and Payments quickly so that the app makes it to the stores. Then I'll continue improving it as I go and focus on monetization.


## Opus 4.5

Opus 4.5 is pretty good. There are still issues here and there, for example, I don't think it's done as good a job at the vision I mentioned earlier as it could have with better prompting, but it's better than anything else I've used so far. A personal goal is to interact with these models as much as possible.
