## the bhagavad gita

[[books.the-bhagavad-gita]]

### chapter one

- the first chapter is about the battleground and leads to two lines of thought
- one interpretation is that the gita says that war is the _dharma_ of the warriors. although war is evil, it is justified for a just cause.
- the other interpretation is that krishna is asking arjuna to fight against his own lower self, to restore righteousness.

> i do not see that any good can come from killing our relations in battle. O Krishna, i have
> no desire for victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures

> we would become sinners by slaying these men, even though they are evil.


### chapter two

> the wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. there has never been a time
> when you and I and the kings gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time
> when we will cease to exist.
