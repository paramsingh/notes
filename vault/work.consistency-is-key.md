One thing I've figured out is that consistency is really the only key thing to moving towards success.

If you consistently work on something for a long time, it's much more probable that the thing will be a success.

An example to think about is this [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29998108) about the guy spending a few hours every weekday on the same project.


The reason that consistency is key is because [[work.quantity-is-preferable-to-quality]], the more work you put in the higher the quality of your work will become.
