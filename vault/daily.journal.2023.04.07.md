Jeremy Howards from the fast.ai course says that the thing that really matters for good
machine learning models is velocity. You should be able to iterate quickly, and test
out ideas against a baseline.

I got motivated and decided to solve a kaggle problem: https://github.com/paramsingh/ml/blob/main/kaggle/disaster-tweets/01-basic-fastai-model.ipynb

The transfer learning basic puts me in at 600 out of 1100 people which is top 50% I guess.
Now is the time to iterate. I need to think what I can improve.
