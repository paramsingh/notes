Some points for a blog post I want to write about notetaking.

* Books are fun when you're reading them, but it's hard to remember what they said.
* Take notes to help you internalize things, and retain them longer
* Also helpful when you want to write about something, but it's not really original content you'd put on a blog
* Keeping it public helps you stay motivated to keep doing it.
* I use [[engineering.dendron]]
* Also use [[engineering.dendron]] at work, to keep notes about projects, TODO lists, ideas, meeting notes, design docs and such
* A lot of my notes are trivia that is interesting but I know I'll forget if I don't jot down.
* The idea is to not just consume mindlessly, but also produce.
* Once you produce something, you really know it.
* Notes can also be quite a good unit of knowledge to be gained. Instead of thinking I'll read these many pages today, think I'll take these many valid notes today.
