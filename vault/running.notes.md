* I have been doing an average of 27km every week for the past 9 weeks.
* VO2 Max is increasing, garmin says it's 52 now, I started with 48.
* I know the absolute value is likely very inaccurate but the fact that it's increasing gives good signal.
* Also hit my 1k PB after years! 4:25 min/km
* Next up is 5k PB soon.
