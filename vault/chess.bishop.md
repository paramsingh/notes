* An active bishop is one which has diagonals not cluttered by enemy pawns, own pawns or pieces.
* A good bishop is useful and active, it's serving a purpose (for example, defending a pawn) and also active.
* A bishop is called a tall pawn when it's not doing anything useful and is trapped behind its pawns.
* Think before putting your pawns on the same squares as your bishop.
