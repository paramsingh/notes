China's currency in the middle ages was silver, which meant that
it was hugely important for the West as a large demand for silver
helped the West's silver mines stay alive.

From [[books.debt]]:

>By 1540, a silver glut caused a collapse in prices across Europe;
>the American mines would, at this point, simply have stopped functioning
>and the entire American colonization process foundered, had it not been
>for demand from China.

>By the late 16th century, China was importing almost 50 tons of silver
>a year, ~90% of its silver, and in the 17th centure, 116 tons, over 97%.
