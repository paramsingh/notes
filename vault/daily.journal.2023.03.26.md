Woke up at 10:30. Bad dream.

The things I build are more popular on Twitter. It's a nice way
to motivate my lizard brain to actually ship things.

[[ideas]]: I should consider finetuning GPT-3 or something on
good text-based adventure games to see if the quality of the
stories increases

[[todo]]: I also need to figure out a plan of attack on
https://scrollprize.org , my goal for this year is to make
an actual submission I'm proud of.
