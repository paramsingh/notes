Woke up at 10:30. Bad dream.

The things I build are more popular on Twitter. It's a nice way
to motivate my lizard brain to actually ship things.

[[ideas]]: I should consider finetuning GPT-3 or something on
good text-based adventure games to see if the quality of the
stories increases

[[todo]]: I also need to figure out a plan of attack on
https://scrollprize.org , my goal for this year is to make
an actual submission I'm proud of.

[[todo]]: need to upgrade mastodon

[[todo]]: need to look at upgrading dendron on this repo once

I spent the afternoon putting all the ai art i've generated in
one place: [[art-and-photography.ai-art]], looks very cool. Took
a bunch of time to debug some bug and resize the images so that
the page doesn't crap out.
