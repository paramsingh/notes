First president of Tanzania, elected in 1962.

Quite interesting quote about Democracy.

>The two essentials for "representative" democrary are the freedom
>of the individual and the regular opportunity for him to join with
>his fellows in replacing, or reinstating, the governement of his
>country by means of the ballet box and without recourse to
>assassination. An organized opposition is not an essential element,
>although a society which has no reoom and no time for the harmless
>eccenteric can hardly be called "democratic"
