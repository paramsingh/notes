* I'm starting to read [[books.zero-to-sold]].
* I need to build something that actually sells. This is a goal for the next 6 months.
* Ideas are hard to come by, I need to figure out an audience and then focus on building a product that can actually be sold.
* I think the way forward is probably to use something GPT-3 related, but need to figure things out.
* Overall, I think the professional growth I need is in this area.
