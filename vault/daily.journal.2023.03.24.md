Woke up at 7 AM today for a 7:30 meeting. This actually feels quite good.
There's no running around to the next meeting, and I have time to actually
think before getting to work. Will see if I can make this a
regular thing.

I finished [[books.masters-of-doom]] yesterday. One big thing that stuck
with me from the book: Carmack was focussed on the work while Romero
became more and more distracted. Carmack had more success by the end.
Another thing that you learn: Romero tried to hire a lot more and ship
but it doesn't work that way. Carmack had a quote that said something
like "There is an ideal number of people on a project. If there are more
than that, productivity decreases. For id, the number is small". This
is quite relevant to today's layoffs and such.

Next book I'm reading is [[books.the-making-of-prince-of-persia]].

AI is coming for our jobs. I think a lot of people who churn code out
without much sense of what problem the business actually solves are going
to have a hard time. On the other hand, it's a great time to be a
solo dev! You have interns and pair programmers available on demand!
