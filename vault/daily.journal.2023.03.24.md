Woke up at 7 AM today for a 7:30 meeting. This actually feels quite good.
There's no running around to the next meeting, and I have time to actually
think before getting to work. Will see if I can make this a
regular thing.

I finished [[books.masters-of-doom]] yesterday. One big thing that stuck
with me from the book: Carmack was focussed on the work while Romero
became more and more distracted. Carmack had more success by the end.
Another thing that you learn: Romero tried to hire a lot more and ship
but it doesn't work that way. Carmack had a quote that said something
like "There is an ideal number of people on a project. If there are more
than that, productivity decreases. For id, the number is small". This
is quite relevant to today's layoffs and such.

Next book I'm reading is [[books.the-making-of-prince-of-persia]].

AI is coming for our jobs. I think a lot of people who churn code out
without much sense of what problem the business actually solves are going
to have a hard time. On the other hand, it's a great time to be a
solo dev! You have interns and pair programmers available on demand!

This seems like something I should read and know about: https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect

## Uploading myself

Noting down an idea, need to flesh out: if text is the universal interface,
writing as much as possible is a path to immortality. You're basically
changing the data in your brain into a format that a computer can read
and understand. (https://twitter.com/iliekcomputers/status/1639163648966004737)

Exploring this more, what if I fine-tuned GPT-4 on everything I'd ever written
and then chatted with it. How would that work? Would it be good or bad?

## Deep learning

Trying to solve this [Patent matching](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/overview) kaggle problem using things I learned
from [[machine-learning.practical-deep-learning-for-coders.lesson-4]], but struggling.

I need to spend a lot more time actually coding things before I can say with some
confidence that I know a little deep learning.
