Lesson 3 is about [[machine-learning.gradient-descent]].

Corresponds to chapter 4 of the book.

## Book notes

- Tensor jargon - rank is the number of dimensions, shape is the size of each of the axes.

A PyTorch tensor is nearly the same thing as a NumPy array, but with an additional restriction that unlocks some additional capabilities. It's the same in that it, too, is a multidimensional table of data, with all items of the same type. However, the restriction is that a tensor cannot use just any old typeâ€”it has to use a single basic numeric type for all components. For example, a PyTorch tensor cannot be jagged. It is always a regularly shaped multidimensional rectangular structure.
