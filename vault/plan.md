_inspired by (but not exactly) [john carmack's plan](https://github.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive)_

## 2025-01-01

- sign in is _working_ on the app (for some definition of working).
- reading [great by choice](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B005VB99GE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_351_o00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- some notes:
    - 10xers have a few qualities
    - discipline
    - belief in empirical evidence
    - paranoia
    - ambition

quote:

>10Xers then bring this idea to life by a triad of core behaviors: fanatic discipline, empirical creativity, and productive paranoia. Animating these three core behaviors is a central motivating force, Level 5 ambition.
