When dealing with high dimensional data, it's a
good idea to reduce the number of dimensions
by projecting the data to a lower dimension while still
capturing the essence of the data. This is called dimensionality reduction.

Most common approach to dimensionality reduction is called [[machine-learning.principal-components-analysis]].

[[machine-learning.unsupervised-learning]] is helpful for this.
