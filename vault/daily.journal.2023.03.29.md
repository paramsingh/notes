Looks like Stripe's equity has been converted to actual shares.
They've withheld Irish taxes.

My net worth has more than doubled in one day even after the taxes.
Still considering what to do with it. I'll probably sell.

I have a bunch of money that I don't know what to do with. I feel
like I'm wasting my time working this job. With the stripe equity,
I made more money than I'll make in the next 3 years based on my
salary here. Ugh.

And I don't know what to do with this money.
