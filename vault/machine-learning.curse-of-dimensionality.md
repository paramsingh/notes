There's a ton of space in higher dimensional data sets.

The size of the data space grows exponentially with
increase in dimensions. This means that the size of the
dataset must also increase.

[[machine-learning.k-nearest-neighbours]] is susceptible to this issue because it requires a dense data set for good results.
