RSA had already been developed by GCHQ (British signals intelligence agency) in 1973, 4 years before it's discovery by the academics.


I wonder what kind of classified scientific knowledge worldwide security agencies have currently that might change the world.


It's an interesting thing to think about in the context of [[engineering.superintelligence]]. Perhaps there are secret projects developing them right now.
