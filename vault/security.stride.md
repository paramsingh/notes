STRIDE is a strategy used to create [[threat models|security.threat_modeling]].

It is a mnemonic which we should look at while thinking of
threats to the system.

* Spoofing -- Can I perform actions as if I was someone else?
* Tampering -- Can I modify data to my advantage?
* Repudiation -- Can I make it look like someone else is performing my actions?
* Information Disclosure -- Can I get access to data that I should not have access to?
* Denial of Service -- Can I bring the service down in some way?
* Elevation of privileges -- Can I do stuff that I should not be allowed to do?
