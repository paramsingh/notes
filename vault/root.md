Hi! I'm Param! This is a place for my personal notes.

My real blog is https://param.codes, but I also cross-post
stuff to my substack: https://paramcodes.substack.com.

I've found that taking notes helps me remember things, and it's nice
to look back on information that you processed years ago. I jot down random things, there's no real structure, but some of these
notes could eventually become blog posts.

Some notes you might find interesting:

* [[laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance]]
* [[engineering.being_a_mentor]]
* [[history.china.dynasties]]
* [[history.india.indira_gandhi]]

I also keep my [[kindle highlights|kindle_highlights]] in here for easy reference.

This is built using [[Dendron|engineering.dendron]] and hosted using
GitHub Pages.
