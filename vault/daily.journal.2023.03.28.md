Woke up late today 10:30 AM.

Going to get my learner's license before I start work.
I need to finish $CURRENT_PROJECT soon and get started
on $NEXT_PROJECT.

@csparker247 replied to my GitHub comment. I need to look
into the current python bindings. I think this is going to
be my project for the week.

I'm feeling a little tired. I think sitting for 10-12 hours
is not a good idea. Going to go for a long run.

After that look at parsing junit xmls and then python
bindings.

[[todo]]: use gpt-4 for adventures.
