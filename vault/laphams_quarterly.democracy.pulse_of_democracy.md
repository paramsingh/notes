Kind of the same quote as in [[laphams_quarterly.democracy.julius_nyerere]].

>the right to vote, to choose between this party or that, is by itself
>not true democracy. Democracy is more than a legal right that the
>citizen exercises on a certain day of the year when he enters a tiny
>polling booth to mark an anonymous X on a ballot form. It is a process
>of constant thought and action on the part of the citizen. It is
>self-educational. It calls for participation, information, the capacity
>to make up one's own mind.
