Spanish conquistador, who led the fall of the Aztecs and brought major parts of Mexico under the Spanish King.

Selected quotes from [[books.debt]]:
>Lived beyond his means, got in trouble, decided to double down and go for broke.

>When the governor canceled the expedition, Cortes ignored him and sailed for the mainland with 600 men, offering them a share in the profits.

>On landing, he burned his boats, staking everything on victory.

>Three years later, through some of the most ingenious, ruthless, brilliant and utterly dishonorable behaviour by a military leader ever recorder, Cortes had his victory.
