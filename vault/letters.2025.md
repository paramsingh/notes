2025 was a big year!

- I got promoted to L3.
- A senior and a staff engineer left my team, so I played the role of team lead for 2 quarters until a new staff engineer was hired.
- I got married! It was a huge effort, requiring months of planning, shopping and organization. It was the most fun party I've been to in my life.
- I broke multiple running PRs: 5k in 24:30 and 10k in 53:30. Ran a total of 1150km which is 150 km below target.
- I built RunAI, an AI running coach, which I've found personally useful, I need to work on making it an actual serious project.
- Vijaya had some health issues. It was quite stressful but we pushed through.
- I read a whole bunch of books, the most interesting being Grant by Ron Chernow.
- Much much more that I'm likely forgetting.

## Misses

- I did not make any progress on the side-projects. It is important that I start making some money there, because the growth I'm seeing at my job will not fit my ambitions.
- While I did do a lot of above L3 work this year, I am still not getting an Exceeds Expectations rating this year. The rating has monetary consequences and was a goal at the beginning of the year that I missed.
- I have gained weight in the last few months, and running has stagnated. It started because I got busy with the wedding but I need to get back on track, improve my diet and start strength training.
- I am not taking enough care of my mother. Her health is declining and she is lonely, I need to be better.


## Looking forward


There are a few principles that I think I need to _live_ in order to have a good 2026.

1. Every second counts.
2. Consistency is key.
3. Focus.

I'm in my 30s now, this is the time to get strategic and focussed.
