News has become more and more irrelevant. Some ten years ago, news used to be THE source for information. Now, it's just clickbait and outrage bait.

The amount of divisiveness that news produces these days for view is going to cause long term issues.

I wrote [this blog post](https://param.codes/2020/sad/) two years ago, I think it's still mostly valid. I have however found that the Economist is a good source to keep up with the world while not dying.
