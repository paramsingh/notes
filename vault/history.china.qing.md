The Qing Dynasty was the last Chinese dynasty. It followed [[the Ming Dynasty | history.china.ming]], starting in
1644 AD and ending in 1912.

The Qing dynasty ruled really well until the 18th century, after which foreign intervention and internal revolts
led to a steady decline.

[[The Opium wars | history.china.opium_wars]] happened under Qing rule, leading to "unequal treaties" that
placed a lot of pressure on the Chinese economy.

The Boxer rebellion also happened late in the Qing rule.

The last Qing emperor abdicated in 1912, followed by the creation of the Republic of China.
