Mathematical induction is a method to prove statements. Two steps:

1. Initial step: Prove that the statement is true for the smallest value of $m$ for which it is defined, usuaully 0 or 1.
2. The Induction step: Prove that from the fact that the statement is true for $$n$$ ("the induction hypothesis"), it follows that the statement is also true for $$n+1$$.
