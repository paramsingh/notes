An imbalance is any significant difference in the two respective positions.

Types of imbalances could be:

* Superior minor piece
* Pawn structure
* Space
* Material
* Control of a key file
* Control of a weak square
* Lead in development
* King safety
* Statics vs Dynamics

The imbalances can help develop detailed plans.
