<p>Woke up at 11 AM today. The waking up at 7 yesterday
kinda screwed things up, I guess.</p>
<p>I did get this week's newsletter done last night.
I used ChatGPT to help me with ideas, and then give
me feedback on the text. It was actually nice
feedback.</p>
<p>Talked with Akhilesh about AI stuff last night. He wants to start
a construction or export business because that stuff is
not going to be disrupted as easily as tech. But I'm not
really interested I feel. I got into tech because I thought
it was cool, not for the money. I see the future as being
more of a solo artist using AI to build even bigger things.</p>
<p>New washing machine being installed today. Why do all these machines
have thousands of options that no one ever uses?</p>
<p>Could all these paragraphs in this journal be tweets? What's stopping
me from just tweeting everything I think of? i guess i'll start just
tweeting things that can be extracted into the 280 character format.</p>
<p>using chatgpt to learn how to run a fastai regression model. it didn't
actually give me a good solution. maybe these things aren't as far
ahead as twitter would lead you to believe. let me try bing.
bing also gives me a <code>text_classifier_learner</code>. maybe i'm the one who's wrong?</p>
<p>ok, nvm. i'm going to start using dall-e to add images to text-adventures
and see where it goes. it won't be text-adventures but it doesn't really matter.
tried to use bing to get dall-e image. the boilerplate component is correct!
it was using fetch instead of the openai client. when i asked it to use the client,
it basically broke. gave me completions first, and then said the client doesn't
have support for the dall-e api, when it does actually. when i told it to
search for it explicitly, it did work though. this is actually a bit negative
for my productivity becasue i get nerd-sniped into making it do the correct thing
instead of just fixing what i want to do and going from there.</p>
<p>I just finished adding images to each text on <a href="https://adventures.param.codes.">https://adventures.param.codes.</a>
The Dall-E prompts come from ChatGPT. This is quite amazing. The images really
add to the experience I think.</p>
<p>Thinking more about this, what stops me from creating entire books of short stories
out of this? Or hell, even movies or shows?</p>
<p>one problem is that there's very little shared context between GPT and Dall-E. For example,
GPT tells Dall-E to draw "creatures" in the same story, but on different prompts and
Dall-E draws different creatures every time. Ideally
this should be just the one model doing both the things, so that it knows
what it's doing.</p>
<p>Talked with Arpit. I'm going to take a shot at automating some data entry startups. Let's
see if we can make some money there.</p>
