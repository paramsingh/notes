His premiership lasted less\nthan 2 years, as Shastri died in the city of Tashkent in Soviet Union.</p>\n<h2 id=\"succession-of-nehru\">Succession of Nehru<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#succession-of-nehru\"></a></h2>\n<p>On Nehru's death, then Congress President K. Kamaraj started looking for the best person\nto succeed Nehru as Prime Minister. Morarji Desai was a probable candidate, however it\nseems that most MPs preferred Lal Bahadur Shastri instead. Shastri was also very close\nto Nehru in his last days, wchich was probably helpful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anti-hindi-agitation-in-madras-1965\">Anti Hindi Agitation in Madras, 1965<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#anti-hindi-agitation-in-madras-1965\"></a></h2>\n<p>There were intense anti-Hindi protests against the Central Government which was trying\nto make Hindi the official language for all government work in 1965. The protests\neventually succeeded, with Shastri speaking on All-India Radio to assure that\nstates would not be forced to use Hindi unless they want to. The Indian Civil Services\nexam would also continue to be conducted in English.</p>\n<p>Shastri was in support of Hindi being the sole official\nlanguage of India, but was forced to reconsider after the protests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"war-with-pakistan-1965\">War with Pakistan, 1965<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#war-with-pakistan-1965\"></a></h2>\n<p>Shastri was a major player in the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965. When Pakistan sent over\narmed belligerents with the hope of sparking a revolt in Kashmir (see Operation Gibraltar), Shastri retaliated\nby attacking West Punjab, aiming for Lahore.</p>\n<p>Shastri was also different from Nehru in the war response, in the sense that he was decisive and\nswift to order the strike across the Punjab border. In comparison, Nehru had refused to\ncall in the air force during the Indo China war.</p>\n<h1 id=\"death\">Death<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#death\"></a></h1>\n<p>Shastri went to Tashkent to sign a peace treaty with Ayub Khan, the Pakistani president. Soviet\nprime minister, Alexei Kosygin was the chieft mediater. The Tashkent agreement mandated withdrawal\nof forces to positions they held before August 5, 1965 and ordery transfer of prisoners of war.</p>\n<p>Shashti died in his sleep of a heart attack, the night the agreement was signed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#references\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/WXPnprSpA1U5HghuSh83D\">Indo-Pakistan war, 1965</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/fc297f60-41d8-4b8a-adaf-170483cb080b\">Sino-Indian war</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/VIlW7aC9gjhCeho0t838Q\">Indira Gandhi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/WXPnprSpA1U5HghuSh83D\">India Pakistan war, 1965</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Notes","desc":"","updated":1676546314176,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"a63bc749050c89d4e92bc7f1ce268820","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":3,"offset":455},"end":{"line":13,"column":59,"offset":511},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"engineering.being_a_mentor","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":514},"end":{"line":14,"column":33,"offset":544},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"engineering.being_a_mentor"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.china.dynasties","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":3,"offset":547},"end":{"line":15,"column":30,"offset":574},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.china.dynasties"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.india.indira_gandhi","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":3,"offset":577},"end":{"line":16,"column":34,"offset":608},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.india.indira_gandhi"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"books","alias":"here","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":35,"offset":644},"end":{"line":18,"column":49,"offset":658},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"books"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"engineering.dendron","alias":"Dendron","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":21,"offset":681},"end":{"line":20,"column":52,"offset":712},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"engineering.dendron"}}],"anchors":{},"children":["05zaQJMyCo5kYcUdfqHbU","3dca4f75-0a84-4596-8fd3-38f0adbef2b9","2fr0tv2ahut83b6g2w81mz0","596IGh04441uyLbbpkFT1","3j8u7RlelDYoffRQgMIYg","vwq8iGNrINwTnn2qz9cR1","J6qb2iUM2ZMqAYgQQELzQ","tbk0j8n293h69lwldtfsg3u","fSkjQcqYZTGdomGRSlszf","T4ea2dCnXXW7SbPu0BnwF","sfaxl8m0scx0iylroh2nt27","G9wFXoaipKfEf6FlKdHH0","qvk3fygz1m6ws2fji5retj1","8zcz6vwjqab27tqeygao1p7","7nAQ226q3pwfVvQ9KSV80","XLgWwAI1l8XFqJ55YDMXU","Y48aQXzL3qv0LWZAG5Kbz","njqts253mv1fp9o0jkcw1fe","ceddHaDRTozEjfGqQbeNi","9bn8iwfv72uv75ionw8ftql","qjsa2cqk7wwmsxkd63tqmzo","i137wds83cgyiqkpuorvrgh","nbajhp0d12thgwdtlxlo4s5","j9m60mwn8tah0puxr287hbz","awb5kxy7q19yk7564umdlz1","sxs92ymdmvudd9w9abdf2xm","maqyjfimzm1xlreqrnp0ubv","occnxujjcmph9kqq4dtx79g","0r968pvsf565fs54ac85ug0","0iug0cqfida2w3bw9r2y39x","71jowrrvmteaz6vmk3ljq0z","4rahpe1jwc8wf301wril41i","ooi7xp8hw96cr9v8eeg0qxn","100p65il8y0afy0ut38euym","ue8gju4jz5sa6s57r0qbkeq","4uelk0suzbfnl472i8zxi5p","56i0l7vo9k1enmfm627d4q1","52ertzgdog1o9jfdtga8vvt","0lisa2vcu9jh435u9gks8p5"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi!
