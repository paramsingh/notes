Users connect their Strava, and the app automatically imports their runs via webhooks. They can chat with the AI coach to get personalized feedback—pacing analysis, recovery suggestions, and training plans based on their actual run history.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Usage &#x26; Compliance</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Does the app involve AI?\nYes—users chat with an AI coach (Claude, via Anthropic's API) to get feedback on their training.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How is Strava data used with AI?\nWhen a user asks for coaching advice, their activity data is included as context in the request to Claude. The AI analyzes it and returns personalized feedback. No Strava data is ever used to train, fine-tune, or pre-train any AI model—it's only used for real-time analysis to help that individual user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compliance with your training restrictions?\nNo Strava data is used to train AI models. Claude is a pre-trained model; we only use it for inference. Anthropic's Commercial Terms (<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms\">https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms</a>) explicitly state \"Anthropic may not train models on Customer Content from Services\"—so even our AI provider is contractually prohibited from training on this data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third-party access?\nOnly Anthropic's Claude API processes the data (for generating responses). They cannot use it for training. No other third parties have access. Each user's data is completely isolated.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Other API Agreement Compliance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data deletion: Deauthorization webhook immediately deletes all user tokens and data. Activity deletion webhooks remove activities from our database. Users can request full data deletion at any time.</li>\n<li>Data isolation: Each user only sees their own activities. No data is aggregated or shared across users.</li>\n<li>Security: All data transmitted over HTTPS. Strava tokens stored securely and refreshed automatically. JWT-based session management.</li>\n<li>Monetization: Subscription fees are for AI coaching functionality, not for access to Strava data.</li>\n<li>Brand compliance: \"Connect with Strava\" button on login, \"Powered by Strava\" in settings, \"View on Strava\" deep links on activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our privacy policy (<a href=\"https://coachvayu.com/privacy\">https://coachvayu.com/privacy</a>) and terms of service (<a href=\"https://coachvayu.com/terms\">https://coachvayu.com/terms</a>) explicitly document our AI data practices.</p>\n<p>Happy to clarify anything else.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>TOS Compliance:</strong> ✓ (check)\n<strong>Brand Guidelines Review:</strong> ✓ (check)</p>\n<p><strong>App Images:</strong> (same screenshots as before)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>coach-vayu-01-login-strava-connect.png</li>\n<li>coach-vayu-02-settings-powered-by-strava.png</li>\n<li>coach-vayu-03-run-detail-view-on-strava.png</li>\n<li>coach-vayu-04-ai-coach-chat.png</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"if-rejected-research--contingency-plan\">If Rejected: Research &#x26; Contingency Plan<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#if-rejected-research--contingency-plan\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"strava-api-policy-context-nov-2024-changes\">Strava API Policy Context (Nov 2024 changes)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#strava-api-policy-context-nov-2024-changes\"></a></h3>\n<p>Key restrictions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>AI/ML Prohibition</strong> - Third parties cannot use Strava data for AI model training OR AI processing</li>\n<li><strong>Data privacy</strong> - Cannot show user data to anyone other than that user (breaks coach-athlete relationships)</li>\n<li><strong>No replicating Strava</strong> - Can't copy their look/feel/functionality</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"precedent-apps-that-got-approved-despite-using-ai\">Precedent: Apps That Got Approved Despite Using AI<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#precedent-apps-that-got-approved-despite-using-ai\"></a></h3>\n<p><strong>Roast My Strava</strong> - AI app that generates humorous commentary from Strava data.

I'm Param! This is a place for my personal notes.\n\nMy website is https://param.codes, and I write more readable\nstuff on my substack: https://newsletter.param.codes.\n\nI've found that taking notes helps me remember things, and it's nice\nto look back on information that you processed years ago. I jot down random things, there's no real structure, but some of these\nnotes could eventually become blog posts.\n\nSome notes you might find interesting:\n\n- [[history.laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance]]\n- [[engineering.being_a_mentor]]\n- [[history.china.dynasties]]\n- [[history.india.indira_gandhi]]\n\nI also keep notes on books I read [[here|books]].\n\nThis is built using [[Dendron|engineering.dendron]] and hosted using\n[GitHub Pages](https://github.com/paramsingh/notes).\n\nGet in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iliekcomputers) or email me at `me [at] param [dot] codes`!\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"previewV2Enabled":false,"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.89.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"/param/notes","description":"param's notes"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://notes.param.codes/","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
