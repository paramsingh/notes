The waking up at 7 yesterday\nkinda screwed things up, I guess.</p>\n<p>I did get this week's newsletter done last night.\nI used ChatGPT to help me with ideas, and then give\nme feedback on the text. It was actually nice\nfeedback.</p>\n<p>Talked with Akhilesh about AI stuff last night. He wants to start\na construction or export business because that stuff is\nnot going to be disrupted as easily as tech. But I'm not\nreally interested I feel. I got into tech because I thought\nit was cool, not for the money. I see the future as being\nmore of a solo artist using AI to build even bigger things.</p>\n<p>New washing machine being installed today. Why do all these machines\nhave thousands of options that no one ever uses?</p>\n<p>Could all these paragraphs in this journal be tweets? What's stopping\nme from just tweeting everything I think of? i guess i'll start just\ntweeting things that can be extracted into the 280 character format.</p>\n<p>using chatgpt to learn how to run a fastai regression model. it didn't\nactually give me a good solution. maybe these things aren't as far\nahead as twitter would lead you to believe. let me try bing.\nbing also gives me a <code>text_classifier_learner</code>. maybe i'm the one who's wrong?</p>\n<p>ok, nvm. i'm going to start using dall-e to add images to text-adventures\nand see where it goes. it won't be text-adventures but it doesn't really matter.\ntried to use bing to get dall-e image. the boilerplate component is correct!\nit was using fetch instead of the openai client. when i asked it to use the client,\nit basically broke. gave me completions first, and then said the client doesn't\nhave support for the dall-e api, when it does actually. when i told it to\nsearch for it explicitly, it did work though. this is actually a bit negative\nfor my productivity becasue i get nerd-sniped into making it do the correct thing\ninstead of just fixing what i want to do and going from there.</p>\n<p>I just finished adding images to each text on <a href=\"https://adventures.param.codes.\">https://adventures.param.codes.</a>\nThe Dall-E prompts come from ChatGPT. This is quite amazing. The images really\nadd to the experience I think.</p>\n<p>Thinking more about this, what stops me from creating entire books of short stories\nout of this? Or hell, even movies or shows?</p>\n<p>one problem is that there's very little shared context between GPT and Dall-E. For example,\nGPT tells Dall-E to draw \"creatures\" in the same story, but on different prompts and\nDall-E draws different creatures every time. Ideally\nthis should be just the one model doing both the things, so that it knows\nwhat it's doing.</p>\n<p>Talked with Arpit. I'm going to take a shot at automating some data entry startups. Let's\nsee if we can make some money there.</p>\n<p>Also, wondering if I should just focus every moment of my life on <a href=\"https://scrollprize.org\">https://scrollprize.org</a> .</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Notes","desc":"","updated":1676546314176,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"a63bc749050c89d4e92bc7f1ce268820","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":3,"offset":455},"end":{"line":13,"column":59,"offset":511},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"engineering.being_a_mentor","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":514},"end":{"line":14,"column":33,"offset":544},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"engineering.being_a_mentor"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.china.dynasties","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":3,"offset":547},"end":{"line":15,"column":30,"offset":574},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.china.dynasties"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.india.indira_gandhi","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":3,"offset":577},"end":{"line":16,"column":34,"offset":608},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.india.indira_gandhi"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"books","alias":"here","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":35,"offset":644},"end":{"line":18,"column":49,"offset":658},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"books"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"engineering.dendron","alias":"Dendron","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":21,"offset":681},"end":{"line":20,"column":52,"offset":712},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"engineering.dendron"}}],"anchors":{},"children":["05zaQJMyCo5kYcUdfqHbU","3dca4f75-0a84-4596-8fd3-38f0adbef2b9","2fr0tv2ahut83b6g2w81mz0","596IGh04441uyLbbpkFT1","3j8u7RlelDYoffRQgMIYg","vwq8iGNrINwTnn2qz9cR1","J6qb2iUM2ZMqAYgQQELzQ","tbk0j8n293h69lwldtfsg3u","fSkjQcqYZTGdomGRSlszf","T4ea2dCnXXW7SbPu0BnwF","G9wFXoaipKfEf6FlKdHH0","qvk3fygz1m6ws2fji5retj1","8zcz6vwjqab27tqeygao1p7","7nAQ226q3pwfVvQ9KSV80","XLgWwAI1l8XFqJ55YDMXU","Y48aQXzL3qv0LWZAG5Kbz","njqts253mv1fp9o0jkcw1fe","ceddHaDRTozEjfGqQbeNi","9bn8iwfv72uv75ionw8ftql","9mktb5y6nj7k2ybk8skpluv","8hwssya27ueepgrhlpdrfjd","7gck2zgd0zwdmgk9qgpos18","f01xrwkzbb4fzmupyjke59w","lqzeenqabtz689u30ii9azs","m1jb1iraefzo1rm6etj0du4","7can3uzghi01mfsp134rspp","q7wfcfca8zpa4z1i311vbq5","qyxwih7t2evrubc8r1ei6cb","w7j8brta5l7nl4s9izbzqns","n71onqf9jip4rfm15wkhkcr","paatgicnci0cib43y2dq09m","tpt26m8fl897kze8lssgt00"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi!
