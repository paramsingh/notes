Awami League, a party that was in strong favour\nof East Pakistan's right to self-govern won a majority (167 of 169 seats).

The Indian government followed an open-door policy, anyone who came was allowed in.</p>\n<p>India was hosting training camps for Bengali guerillas by the summer of 1971.</p>\n<p>The US (under Nixon) was pretty anti India because of Indian actions during this time.</p>\n<p>On 3rd December 1971, Pakistani bombers attacked airfields in India on the western border.\n<a href=\"/notes/VIlW7aC9gjhCeho0t838Q\">Indira Gandhi</a> said that this amounted to a declaration of war and India retaliated with massive air strikes.</p>\n<p>The Indian army moved towards Dhaka from multiple directions.
