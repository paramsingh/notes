This actually feels quite good.\nThere's no running around to the next meeting, and I have time to actually\nthink before getting to work. Will see if I can make this a\nregular thing.</p>\n<p>I finished <a href=\"/notes/hcdzcgflufb3w4km172lneb\">Masters of Doom</a> yesterday. One big thing that stuck\nwith me from the book: Carmack was focussed on the work while Romero\nbecame more and more distracted. Carmack had more success by the end.\nAnother thing that you learn: Romero tried to hire a lot more and ship\nbut it doesn't work that way. Carmack had a quote that said something\nlike \"There is an ideal number of people on a project. If there are more\nthan that, productivity decreases. For id, the number is small\". This\nis quite relevant to today's layoffs and such.</p>\n<p>Next book I'm reading is <a href=\"/notes/vf4rhd6s85t2c8l27u9ru5i\">The Making of Prince of Persia</a>.</p>\n<p>AI is coming for our jobs. I think a lot of people who churn code out\nwithout much sense of what problem the business actually solves are going\nto have a hard time. On the other hand, it's a great time to be a\nsolo dev! You have interns and pair programmers available on demand!</p>\n<p>This seems like something I should read and know about: <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect\">https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"uploading-myself\">Uploading myself<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#uploading-myself\"></a></h2>\n<p>Noting down an idea, need to flesh out: if text is the universal interface,\nwriting as much as possible is a path to immortality.
