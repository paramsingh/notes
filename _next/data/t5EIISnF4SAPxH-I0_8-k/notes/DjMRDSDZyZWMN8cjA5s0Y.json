They can also make humans\ndo the bare minimum (or even less).</p>\n<p>Let's do a couple of examples.</p>\n<p>I'll start with my alma mater (where else would I start with other than NIT Hamirpur,\nthat microcosm simulating the real world in so many ways). Getting into the college\ninvolves passing a mind-numbingly competitive exam and realistically only very\nhard working people are admitted into the college. However, the quality of the engineers (or researchers)\ngraduating from the college is very obviously sub-optimal. This isn't a controversial\nclaim at all, and the same can be said for thousands of colleges across India.\nHere's the most probable cause in my opinion. The examinations at NITH are essentially fake,\nwith students getting great grades for writing long paragraphs that don't even need\nto make sense into paper. What this means is that there is no real incentive to\nactually understand the course material. Even if a student is particularly\nhard-working, the thing they'll work hard on is rote learning which won't lead\nto any long term benefits. The college is incentivizing the wrong thing\nand that's why a majority of graduating engineers are sub-par.</p>\n<p>Let's do another example. A idealistic person gives a competitive exam and gets\na job in the Indian public sector, the coveted government job well-paid and stable.\nThe person has worked hard for the job and is prepared to work hard in the future as\nwell. However, they soon realize that growth in the public sector is not dependent on\nperformance or hard work or such trivial things, what really matters is who you know\nand who knows you. The way to get ahead is not to work hard (leading to personal\nand organizational growth), but to play politics, push others down and get head.\nEveryone else in the organization is doing it, you won't go anywhere if you don't.\nThe incentives in most government organizations are upside-down, which is why\nthey're inefficient and corrupt. There's a reason why the market cap of HDFC is\ntwice the market cap of SBI. It's because HDFC doesn't incentivize playing a zero-sum\ngame of politics and status, instead incentivizing performance.</p>\n<p>Humans are remarkably resourceful creatures. The amount of technology\nwe as a two limbed species have developed in our small lifetime is mind-blowing.\nHowever, growth is faster in some places and slower in others. Most of these\ndifferences in rate of growth can be attributed to different incentives. As individuals\nin control of organizations and institutions today (or in the future), we should\nbe very mindful of what incentives we're creating and whether they will actually lead\nto the outcome that we want. If you want something to grow, you need to give stakeholders\nthe incentive to help it grow.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"Notes","desc":"","updated":1676546314176,"created":1595961348801,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"a63bc749050c89d4e92bc7f1ce268820","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":3,"offset":455},"end":{"line":13,"column":59,"offset":511},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.laphams_quarterly.democracy.campaign_finance"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"engineering.being_a_mentor","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":514},"end":{"line":14,"column":33,"offset":544},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"engineering.being_a_mentor"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.china.dynasties","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":3,"offset":547},"end":{"line":15,"column":30,"offset":574},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.china.dynasties"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"history.india.indira_gandhi","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":3,"offset":577},"end":{"line":16,"column":34,"offset":608},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"history.india.indira_gandhi"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"books","alias":"here","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":35,"offset":644},"end":{"line":18,"column":49,"offset":658},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"books"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"root","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"engineering.dendron","alias":"Dendron","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":21,"offset":681},"end":{"line":20,"column":52,"offset":712},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"engineering.dendron"}}],"anchors":{},"children":["05zaQJMyCo5kYcUdfqHbU","3dca4f75-0a84-4596-8fd3-38f0adbef2b9","2fr0tv2ahut83b6g2w81mz0","596IGh04441uyLbbpkFT1","3j8u7RlelDYoffRQgMIYg","vwq8iGNrINwTnn2qz9cR1","J6qb2iUM2ZMqAYgQQELzQ","tbk0j8n293h69lwldtfsg3u","fSkjQcqYZTGdomGRSlszf","T4ea2dCnXXW7SbPu0BnwF","G9wFXoaipKfEf6FlKdHH0","qvk3fygz1m6ws2fji5retj1","8zcz6vwjqab27tqeygao1p7","7nAQ226q3pwfVvQ9KSV80","XLgWwAI1l8XFqJ55YDMXU","Y48aQXzL3qv0LWZAG5Kbz","njqts253mv1fp9o0jkcw1fe","ceddHaDRTozEjfGqQbeNi","9bn8iwfv72uv75ionw8ftql","9mktb5y6nj7k2ybk8skpluv","8hwssya27ueepgrhlpdrfjd","7gck2zgd0zwdmgk9qgpos18","f01xrwkzbb4fzmupyjke59w","lqzeenqabtz689u30ii9azs","m1jb1iraefzo1rm6etj0du4","7can3uzghi01mfsp134rspp","q7wfcfca8zpa4z1i311vbq5","qyxwih7t2evrubc8r1ei6cb","w7j8brta5l7nl4s9izbzqns","n71onqf9jip4rfm15wkhkcr","paatgicnci0cib43y2dq09m","tpt26m8fl897kze8lssgt00"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi!
